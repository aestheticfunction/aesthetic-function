# Aesthetic Function — Architecture Reference

> **This document is the authoritative source of truth for system behavior.** AI agents and contributors should prioritize this over README.md when resolving questions about runtime boundaries, reconciliation semantics, or architectural constraints.

> For a product overview, see [README.md](../README.md).

This document is the source of truth for AF's runtime boundaries, reconciliation semantics, phase invariants, and adapter constraints. It preserves all architectural guarantees that implementations must respect.

---

## Core Identity

A bidirectional Code ↔ Design synchronization system for UI frameworks (React, Vue) and Figma. The pipeline is deterministic by default, using `@figma` comment markers to extract design intent. An optional LLM-based analyzer can be enabled via feature flag, with automatic fallback to marker parsing on failure.

## Architectural Invariants

These invariants are **frozen** and must not be violated by any future phase:

1. **AF is the only mutation authority.** Writes to Figma flow through watcher → server → plugin. No external tool, adapter, or MCP server may write to Figma.
2. **Deterministic precedence:** `override > marker > ast > code`. Implemented in `resolveField()` / `resolveWithPolicy()`.
3. **Three-runtime boundary:** Watcher (reconciliation), Server (relay + persistence + audit), Plugin (mutation executor). No runtime may assume another runtime's responsibilities.
4. **The CLI is a control surface, not a runtime authority.** It delegates to watcher/server modules; it does not own reconciliation logic.
5. **Design adapters are read-only unless explicitly allowed.** The MCP adapter uses a default-deny tool policy. Write tools are blocked architecturally, not by omission.
6. **Echo suppression prevents feedback loops.** AST writes trigger file saves, which re-trigger the watcher. The echo guard cache suppresses duplicate operations.
7. **Reconciliation semantics are frozen at Phase 14F.** Later phases add configuration, tooling, and adapters — they do not change how reconciliation resolves.

### MVP Freeze (Phase 14F)

As of Phase 14F, the reconciliation system is **feature-complete and stable**. The `figma:reconcile` command provides a single entry point for the full Phase 12–14 analysis pipeline, with CI integration via GitHub Actions matrix workflows.

Phase 15 adds a configuration layer, named policy profiles, artifact inspection tooling, and a unified `af` CLI control surface. No reconciliation semantics changed.

Phase 16 adds a design adapter interface, a Figma Console MCP adapter, and a surface classification metadata layer. Adapters are read-only and non-authoritative. They do not participate in reconciliation decisions. The surface classification layer categorizes adapters along four independent dimensions (surface type, access mode, authority role, stability) without affecting behavior.

### Data Flow

1. **Code → Design**: `File Change → Watcher → IntentModel → FigmaOperations → Server → Plugin → Figma`
2. **Design → Code**: `Figma Selection → Plugin → Server → DESIGN_CHANGE → design-overrides.json`
3. **Reconciliation**: On next file save, overrides are merged with code-derived intents before sending to Figma

### Packages

| Package | Runtime | Responsibility |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `@aesthetic-function/watcher` | Local Node.js | Watches files, extracts intent (markers or LLM), reconciles with overrides, transforms to operations, sends to server |
| `@aesthetic-function/server` | Local Node.js | HTTP/WebSocket relay bridge, persists design changes to `design-overrides.json`, audit logging |
| `@aesthetic-function/figma-plugin` | Figma Sandbox | Receives operations, executes scene graph mutations, sends selection changes back |
| `@aesthetic-function/shared` | Shared | Protocol definitions, message types, version constants |
| `@aesthetic-function/cli` | Local Node.js | Thin CLI control surface (`af` binary), delegates to watcher/server modules |

### Runtime Boundaries (Critical)

- **Watcher** CAN access disk and LLMs
- **Server** CAN access disk and network
- **Figma `code.ts`** CANNOT access disk or network
- **Figma `ui.html`** CAN access network but MUST NOT assume localhost is reachable

## Project Configuration (Phase 15A)

Phase 15A adds a portable project configuration file (`af.config.json`) that replaces per-invocation environment variables while remaining fully backward compatible.

### Configuration File

Create an `af.config.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "profile": "designer-first",
  "server": {
    "port": 3001,
    "url": "http://localhost:3001"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "enabled": true,
    "precedence": "always"
  },
  "canonical": {
    "colorStrategy": "token-first",
    "strict": false
  }
}
```

All fields are optional. Without `af.config.json`, the system behaves identically to Phase 14F (environment variables + built-in defaults).

### Merge Precedence

Configuration values are resolved in order (lowest → highest priority):

1. **Built-in defaults** — match existing Phase 14F behavior
2. **`af.config.json`** — version-controlled project settings
3. **Environment variables** — always override file values (backward compatible)

Existing env vars (`USE_OVERRIDES`, `OVERRIDES_PRECEDENCE`, `CANONICAL_STRICT`, etc.) continue to work and always take priority over the config file.

### Named Policy Profiles (Phase 15B)

Profiles are named presets that map onto the existing `resolveField()` / `resolveWithPolicy()` engine. They do **not** modify resolution logic — they set parameters.

| Profile | `USE_OVERRIDES` | `OVERRIDES_PRECEDENCE` | `ColorStrategy` | Conflict Action |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `designer-first` | `true` | `always` | `token-first` | apply |
| `code-first` | `true` | `if_newer_than_code` | `token-first` | apply |
| `balanced` | `true` | `if_newer_than_code` | `token-first` | warn |
| `strict-review` | `true` | `always` | `token-only` | block |

- **`designer-first`** is the default and produces identical behavior to Phase 14F
- **`code-first`** maps to existing `OVERRIDES_PRECEDENCE=if_newer_than_code` behavior
- **`balanced`** adds conflict warnings on top of code-first precedence
- **`strict-review`** blocks all conflicts for human review with strict token policy

Set the profile in `af.config.json` or via `RECONCILIATION_POLICY` environment variable:

```bash
# Via config file
echo '{"profile": "code-first"}' > af.config.json

# Via environment variable (always overrides config file)
RECONCILIATION_POLICY=code-first pnpm dev:watcher
```

### Artifact Inspector (Phase 15D)

Phase 15D adds read-only inspection tooling for the 12 reconciliation artifact types. All commands are additive — no new artifacts are generated, no reconciliation logic is modified.

**CLI Commands:**

```bash
# List all artifacts for a source file (12 types)
pnpm artifacts:list demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# Inspect a single artifact with type-aware highlights
pnpm artifacts:inspect design-materializations/demos__react-demo-app__src__App.figma-reconciliation-status.json

# End-to-end lifecycle trace across all artifacts
pnpm artifacts:trace demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
```

All three commands support `--json` for machine-readable output and `--repo-root` for explicit repo root.

**Highlight Levels:**

| Icon | Level | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| ✓ | ok | Passing / verified |
| ⚠ | warn | Warning / dry-run |
| ✗ | fail | Failure / mismatch |
| · | info | Informational |

**Audit Log Expansion:**

The server audit log (`sync-log.md`) now accepts optional metadata fields when present:
- `profile` — active policy profile name
- `configSource` — path to the config file used
- `policy` — policy settings snapshot (JSON)

These fields are purely additive. Existing callers are unaffected.

### Unified CLI Control Surface (Phase 15C)

Phase 15C adds the `af` binary — a thin CLI control surface that delegates every command to existing watcher/server modules. The CLI does NOT own the runtime, reconciliation logic, or server authority.

**Installation:**

The CLI lives in `packages/cli/`. It is currently a **workspace-only** tool — it must be run from within the aesthetic-function monorepo.

**Runtime requirements:**
- Must run from within the monorepo (needs `packages/watcher/src/` and `packages/server/src/`)
- Requires `tsx` (installed as a workspace dev dependency)
- Delegates to `.ts` source files directly via `fork()` with `--import tsx` — no pre-build step
- Existing `pnpm --filter` commands continue to work unchanged

In development, run via tsx:

```bash
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/cli dev -- <command> [args]
```

**Commands:**

| Command | Delegates To | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `af init` | standalone | Generate `af.config.json` |
| `af run` | server + watcher (child processes) | Spawn both processes |
| `af reconcile <file>` | `reconciliationReconcile/cliReconcile` | Full reconciliation pipeline |
| `af status <file>` | `reconciliationStatus/cliStatus` | Reconciliation status |
| `af dashboard <file>` | `reconciliationDashboard/cliDashboard` | Drift dashboard (file-level) |
| `af dashboard --project <dir>` | `reconciliationProjectDashboard/cliProjectDashboard` | Drift dashboard (project-level) |
| `af ci [dir]` | `reconciliationCi/cliCi` | CI gate summary |
| `af artifacts list <file>` | `artifactInspector/cliArtifactList` | List artifacts |
| `af artifacts inspect <path>` | `artifactInspector/cliArtifactInspect` | Inspect artifact |
| `af artifacts trace <file>` | `artifactInspector/cliArtifactTrace` | Lifecycle trace |

**Architecture:**

- `af init` detects project context (framework, existing artifacts) and writes `af.config.json` — does NOT start the system
- `af run` spawns server + watcher as child processes via `fork()` — it is a launcher, not a runtime
- All other commands load `af.config.json` via `loadAfConfig()`, derive env vars via `envBridge.ts`, then fork the target watcher CLI module with `--import tsx` and those env vars
- The env var names (`CANONICAL_COLOR_STRATEGY`, `OVERRIDES_PRECEDENCE`, etc.) match exactly what the watcher/server modules read from `process.env`
- Existing `pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher` commands continue to work unchanged

**The CLI does NOT:**
- Implement reconciliation logic
- Modify policy behavior
- Bypass the server
- Write overrides directly
- Replace the watcher or server runtime

---

## Variant/State Mapping (Phase 8A)

Phase 8A adds a state dimension to the intent pipeline, enabling synchronization of different component states (base, disabled, hover, pressed) to Figma.

### Component States

| State | Description | Figma Node Name |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| `base` | Default state (no suffix) | `LoginButton` |
| `hover` | Mouse hover state | `LoginButton::hover` |
| `disabled` | Disabled/inactive state | `LoginButton::disabled` |
| `pressed` | Active/pressed state | `LoginButton::pressed` |

### Marker Syntax

Use the `state=` attribute to specify component state:

```tsx
// @figma node=LoginButton fill=#3B82F6 text="Login"
// @figma node=LoginButton state=hover fill=#2563EB text="Login"
// @figma node=LoginButton state=disabled fill=#9CA3AF text="Login"
// @figma node=LoginButton state=pressed fill=#1E40AF text="Login"
```

### Figma Naming Convention

Operations target nodes using a `::` suffix for non-base states:

- **Base state**: `LoginButton` (no suffix)
- **Hover state**: `LoginButton::hover`
- **Disabled state**: `LoginButton::disabled`
- **Pressed state**: `LoginButton::pressed`

In your Figma document, name nodes to match this convention or use component variants.

### Override Keys

Design overrides support per-state keys:

```json
{
  "LoginButton": {
    "nodeId": "4:7",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "fill": "#3B82F6",
    "text": "Sign In"
  },
  "LoginButton::hover": {
    "nodeId": "4:8",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "fill": "#2563EB"
  },
  "LoginButton::disabled": {
    "nodeId": "4:9",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "fill": "#9CA3AF"
  }
}
```

### AST State Inference

The system can infer `disabled` state from JSX with high confidence:

```tsx
<Button disabled={true}>Submit</Button>  // → state: 'disabled'
```

Note: `hover` and `pressed` states cannot be inferred from static JSX and must be explicitly declared via markers.

---

## Native Figma Variant Targeting (Phase 8B)

Phase 8B adds first-class support for Figma Component Sets with variants. Instead of requiring designers to manually name nodes like `LoginButton::hover`, the plugin can now resolve variant components directly from Component Sets.

### How It Works

When an operation targets `LoginButton::hover`:

1. **Parse variant query**: Extract `baseName=LoginButton`, `state=hover`
2. **Find Component Set**: Search current page for a Component Set named `LoginButton`
3. **Resolve variant**: Find the variant with `State=Hover` property
4. **Execute operation**: Apply changes to the resolved variant component

If no Component Set is found, it falls back to finding a node literally named `LoginButton::hover`.

### Figma Component Set Setup

For variant targeting to work, your Figma document needs:

1. **Component Set** named after your component (e.g., `LoginButton`)
2. **Variants** with a `State` property containing values like:
   - `Base` or `Default` (for base state)
   - `Hover` (for hover state)
   - `Disabled` (for disabled state)
   - `Pressed` (for pressed state)

Example Component Set structure in Figma:
```
LoginButton (Component Set)
├── State=Base (variant component)
├── State=Hover (variant component)
├── State=Disabled (variant component)
└── State=Pressed (variant component)
```

### State Mapping

The plugin maps code states to Figma property values:

| Code State | Figma Property Values |
|------------|----------------------|
| `base` | Base, Default |
| `hover` | Hover |
| `disabled` | Disabled |
| `pressed` | Pressed |

Property names checked: `State`, `state`, `Variant` (in that order).

### Variant Info in DESIGN_CHANGE

When a designer selects a variant component and clicks "Send Selection", the plugin now detects the variant context and includes the `NodeName::state` format in the message:

```json
{
  "type": "DESIGN_CHANGE",
  "payload": {
    "nodeName": "LoginButton::hover",
    "changes": [{ "changeType": "fill", "value": "#2563EB" }]
  }
}
```

This enables the reconciliation layer to store overrides with the correct state key.

### Diagnostic: DEBUG_LIST_VARIANTS

Set `DEBUG_LIST_VARIANTS = true` in `packages/figma-plugin/src/code.ts` to log all Component Sets and their variants on plugin startup:

```
[Figma Plugin] Found 2 Component Set(s):
  - "LoginButton" with 4 variant(s):
      • State=Base (State=Base)
      • State=Hover (State=Hover)
      • State=Disabled (State=Disabled)
      • State=Pressed (State=Pressed)
  - "IconButton" with 2 variant(s):
      • State=Default (State=Default)
      • State=Hover (State=Hover)
```

### Example Markers

Target specific variants with the standard `::state` syntax:

```tsx
// @figma node=LoginButton fill=#3B82F6 text="Login"
// @figma node=LoginButton::hover fill=#2563EB
// @figma node=LoginButton::disabled fill=#9CA3AF
// @figma node=LoginButton::pressed fill=#1E40AF
```

The plugin will:
1. Look for a Component Set named `LoginButton`
2. Resolve the variant with the matching state
3. Apply the fill color to that variant

---

## Component Mapping Registry (Phase 8C)

Phase 8C adds a deterministic mapping registry (`component-map.json`) that stores stable Figma node IDs for components and their variants. This enables sync targets to remain stable across renames and refactors.

### Why Stable IDs?

Figma node IDs remain constant for the lifetime of a node, even if:
- The node is renamed
- The node is moved to a different page
- The Component Set is reorganized

Without stable IDs, renaming a button from "LoginButton" to "SignInButton" would break all sync mappings. With stable IDs, the watcher uses the stored node ID directly.

### How It Works

1. **Send Selection**: When a designer selects a variant and clicks "Send Selection", the plugin sends both the DESIGN_CHANGE and a map update to the server
2. **Map Storage**: The server merges the update into `component-map.json` at the repo root
3. **Watcher Resolution**: On file save, the watcher checks `component-map.json` for a mapped node ID and uses `id:<nodeId>` format if found
4. **Plugin Resolution**: The plugin resolves `id:` prefixed queries using `figma.getNodeById()` for direct lookup

### Registry Format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "components": {
    "LoginButton": {
      "figma": {
        "componentSetNodeId": "12:34",
        "name": "LoginButton",
        "variants": {
          "base": { "nodeId": "12:35" },
          "hover": { "nodeId": "12:36" },
          "pressed": { "nodeId": "12:37" },
          "disabled": { "nodeId": "12:38" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Resolution Flow

```
Marker: @figma node=LoginButton::hover
          ↓
Watcher: Check component-map.json
          ↓
Found: LoginButton.figma.variants.hover.nodeId = "12:36"
          ↓
Emit: nodeQuery = "id:12:36"
          ↓
Plugin: figma.getNodeById("12:36") → direct node access
```

If no mapping exists, the watcher falls back to name-based resolution (`LoginButton::hover`).

### Git Configuration

By default, `component-map.json` is gitignored (local state). To commit it for team sharing:

```bash
# Remove from .gitignore or add exception
echo '!component-map.json' >> .gitignore

# Commit the map
git add component-map.json
git commit -m "Add component mapping for stable Figma IDs"
```

**Pros of committing**:
- Team members get the same stable mappings
- Mappings survive local file deletion

**Pros of ignoring**:
- Each developer has their own Figma document
- No merge conflicts on mapping files

### Environment Variable

Control component map usage:

```bash
# Disable component map resolution
USE_COMPONENT_MAP=false pnpm watcher

# Enable explicitly (default if file exists)
USE_COMPONENT_MAP=true pnpm watcher
```

### Fallback Behavior

- If `component-map.json` doesn't exist: name-based resolution only
- If component exists but variant missing: warns and falls back to name
- If `id:` query fails (node deleted): warns and tries name-based resolution
- If multiple Component Sets share a name: fails loudly (ambiguous)

---

## AST Analysis (Phase 6A)

Phase 6A adds read-only AST-based analysis using Babel to extract literal semantics from JSX. This enables deeper code understanding and produces structured reports for diffing against markers and design overrides.

### What It Extracts

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **JSX Text Literals** | `<h1>Welcome</h1>` → "Welcome" |
| **JSX Prop Literals** | `<button disabled={true}>` → disabled: true |
| **Inline Style Literals** | `style={{ backgroundColor: "#FF0000" }}` → backgroundColor: "#FF0000" |

**Scope**: Literals only. No inference from variables, no className parsing, no evaluation.

### Marker Anchoring

The AST analyzer maps `@figma` markers to components:

1. Finds all `// @figma node=...` markers with their line numbers
2. For each marker, finds the nearest following exported component
3. Extracts text and fill literals from that component
4. Produces an anchored report linking markers to actual JSX content

### CLI Report

Run a diff report on any TSX file:

```bash
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher ast:report demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
```

Output includes:
- **Marker Summary**: Nodes and their text/fill values from markers
- **AST Anchored Summary**: Marker → Component → Extracted literals
- **Diff: JSX vs Marker**: Mismatches between JSX code and marker declarations
- **Diff: JSX vs Overrides**: Mismatches between JSX code and design-overrides.json

Example output:
```
AST REPORT
File: demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

============================================================
MARKER SUMMARY
============================================================
  [L25] LoginButton
    text: "Login"
    fill: #883BF5

============================================================
AST ANCHORED SUMMARY
============================================================
  [L25] LoginButton
    → LoginButton (L26-43)
    text: ["Sign In"]
    fills: [#3B82F6]

============================================================
DIFF: JSX vs MARKER
============================================================
  ✗ LoginButton.text
    JSX: Sign In
    Marker: Login
  ✗ LoginButton.fill
    JSX: #3B82F6
    Marker: #883BF5

Summary: 3 markers, 4 components, 4 mismatches
```

### Use Cases

- **Auditing**: See drift between markers and actual code
- **Validation**: Ensure markers match component content
- **Pre-commit checks**: Detect undeclared changes before sync

---

## AST Semantic Extraction (Phase 6B/6C)

Phase 6B adds deeper semantic extraction from JSX to understand colors, layout, and style patterns. Phase 6C adds feasibility analysis to determine which values can be safely mutated.

### Semantic Categories

| Category | Extraction |
|----------|------------|
| **Fill Colors** | Inline `backgroundColor`, `color` from style objects |
| **Layout** | `gap`, `padding`, `margin` from style objects |
| **Token Mapping** | Reverse-map hex values to design tokens |

### Feasibility Analysis

The feasibility analyzer determines which AST nodes can be safely modified:

| Feasibility | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `LITERAL_EASY` | Direct string/number literal, safe to modify |
| `PROPERTY_SPREAD` | Style object needs spread handling |
| `DYNAMIC_UNSAFE` | Expression/variable, cannot safely modify |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Target not found in AST |

### CLI Report

```bash
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher feasibility:report demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
```

---

## AST Writes (Phase 7A/7B)

Phase 7A/7B implements AST-based source mutation using Babel. This enables direct modification of JSX literals and style objects while preserving formatting.

### What It Can Mutate

| Target | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Marker text** | `// @figma node=X text="Old"` → `text="New"` |
| **Marker fill** | `// @figma node=X fill=#OLD` → `fill=#NEW` |
| **Style properties** | `style={{ backgroundColor: "#OLD" }}` → `"#NEW"` |
| **JSX text** | `<Button>Old</Button>` → `<Button>New</Button>` |

### Dry-Run Mode

By default, AST writes are in dry-run mode (`MATERIALIZE_DRY_RUN=true`):

```
AST Write: Would write the following changes:
  File: demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
  Changes:
    - LoginButton.text: "Login" → "Sign In"
    - LoginButton.fill: "#3B82F6" → "#FF5500"
```

### AST Write Mode

Set `MATERIALIZE_MODE=ast` and `MATERIALIZE_DRY_RUN=false` for actual writes.

---

## Reconciliation Policy (Phase 7C)

Phase 7C defines a unified precedence policy to prevent "source of truth fights" between markers, AST values, and design overrides.

### Precedence Order

When determining the final value for a field:

```
1. override (design-overrides.json)  ← Highest priority
2. marker   (@figma comment)
3. ast      (JSX literal extracted by Babel)
4. code     (fallback)               ← Lowest priority
```

### Resolution Example

```
LoginButton.text resolution:
  code:     "Submit" (from JSX)
  marker:   "Login"  (from @figma comment)
  override: "Sign In" (from design-overrides.json)
  → WINNER: "Sign In" (source: override)
```

### Echo Suppression

After an AST write modifies a file, the watcher may re-trigger from the file save. Echo suppression prevents sending duplicate operations:

1. When AST writes `LoginButton.text = "Sign In"`, record in cache
2. When file save triggers re-parse, check cache
3. If same value detected within TTL (5s default), suppress operation
4. After TTL expires, allow new operations

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ECHO_GUARD` | `true` | Enable echo suppression |
| `ECHO_GUARD_TTL_MS` | `5000` | Cache TTL in milliseconds |
| `OVERRIDES_PRECEDENCE` | `always` | `always` or `if_newer_than_code` |

---

## Override System

### What is `design-overrides.json`?

When a designer makes changes in Figma and sends them back via the plugin's "Send Selection" feature, those changes are captured in `design-overrides.json` at the repository root.

```json
{
  "LoginButton": {
    "nodeId": "4:7",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "text": "Sign In",
    "fill": "#3B82F6"
  }
}
```

### When is it written?

The server writes to this file when it receives a `DESIGN_CHANGE` message from the Figma plugin. Each entry captures:
- `nodeId`: The Figma node ID
- `lastUpdated`: ISO timestamp of when the change was captured
- `text`: Text content (if applicable)
- `fill`: Fill color (if applicable)

### How does reconciliation work?

On each file save, the watcher:
1. Extracts intents from code (markers or LLM)
2. Loads `design-overrides.json` (if it exists)
3. For each intent, checks if an override exists for that node name
4. Applies the override values (text, fill) on top of code-derived values
5. Sends the merged result to Figma

### Override Precedence

By default, **overrides always win** over code values. This ensures designer intent is preserved.

You can control this behavior with environment variables (see below).

> ⚠️ **Warning**: If code edits appear "stuck" (changes not reflected in Figma), check whether an override exists for that node. Delete or edit `design-overrides.json` to reset.

---

## Design → Code Materialization (Phase 5B)

Materialization converts design overrides into reviewable code artifacts. This is an optional feature that must be explicitly enabled.

### Materialization Modes

| Mode | Output | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `off` | None | Default. No materialization occurs. |
| `patch` | `design-materializations/*.patch.json` | Generates JSON patch artifacts for review |
| `markers` | Updated `@figma` marker lines | Edits source files directly |

### Patch Mode

Generates a reviewable artifact without modifying source files:

```json
{
  "file": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
  "generatedAt": "2025-12-14T00:00:00.000Z",
  "changes": [
    {
      "node": "LoginButton",
      "before": { "text": "Login", "fill": "Primary/Blue500" },
      "after": { "text": "Sign in", "fill": "#FF5500" },
      "source": "design-overrides.json",
      "nodeId": "4:7"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Markers Mode

Updates existing `@figma` marker lines in source files:

- Replaces `text="..."` and `fill=...` values
- Only modifies lines that already contain `// @figma node=<NodeName>`
- Does not insert new markers (unapplied overrides are logged)
- Preserves formatting and indentation

### Safety Defaults

- **Dry-run by default**: `MATERIALIZE_DRY_RUN=true` means no files are written
- **Atomic writes**: Uses temp file + rename for safe writes
- **Clear logging**: `Materialize: mode=patch dryRun=true changes=2 unapplied=1`

# Feature Orchestrator: Generate a patch artifact (dry-run by default)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher feature \
  --file demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx \
  --component LoginButton \
  --state hover \
  --prompt "Make the hover state button use the success green token"

---

## Fast Demo: Immediate Figma Refresh (Phase 9B)

This section shows how to use the Feature Orchestrator with immediate Figma updates.

### Prerequisites

1. **Start the server** (with optional tunnel for remote Figma access):
   ```bash
   pnpm dev:server
   ```

2. **Start the watcher** (for normal file-change sync):
   ```bash
   pnpm dev:watcher
   ```

3. **Load the Figma plugin**:
   - Open Figma Desktop
   - Run the plugin from `Plugins > Development > Import plugin from manifest...`
   - Point to `packages/figma-plugin/manifest.json`

4. **Ensure your Figma document has matching nodes**:
   - Create a frame named `LoginButton` (or `LoginButton::hover` for state variants)
   - Alternatively, create a Component Set named `LoginButton` with `State=Hover` variant

### Run Feature Orchestrator with POST_APPLY_EMIT

```bash
POST_APPLY_EMIT=true AST_WRITE_MODE=write AST_WRITE_DRY_RUN=false \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher feature \
  --file demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx \
  --component LoginButton \
  --state hover \
  --prompt "Make the hover state button use the success green token and change its label to 'Continue'" \
  --apply
```

### What Happens

1. **LLM generates changes**: The orchestrator calls the LLM with the prompt and code context
2. **State-aware apply**: Hover state changes go to markers/overrides (not base JSX)
3. **Post-apply emit**: Immediately after apply, the system:
   - Reads the updated file from disk
   - Parses the intent model
   - Applies reconciliation and overrides
   - Transforms to FigmaOperations
   - Sends to the server
4. **Figma updates**: Connected Figma plugin receives operations and updates the document

### Expected Output

```
[Orchestrator] Processing feature request for demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
[Orchestrator] Prompt: "Make the hover state button use the success green token..."
...
[Orchestrator] Successfully applied changes
[Orchestrator] Post-apply emit: enabled
[PostApplyEmit] Starting emit for demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
[PostApplyEmit] Component: LoginButton, State: hover
[PostApplyEmit] Using marker parser...
[PostApplyEmit] Generated 2 operation(s)
[PostApplyEmit] ✓ Sent 2 ops (1 client(s))
[Orchestrator] Post-apply emit: ops=2 sent=true clients=1
```

### Watcher Suppression

When `POST_APPLY_EMIT` is enabled:
- The feature orchestrator records the file path after emit
- The watcher detects the file change but **suppresses** the duplicate send
- Logs show: `[Watcher] Suppressed: demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx (recently emitted by Feature Orchestrator)`

This prevents double-updates to Figma.

---

## Observability (Phase 9C)

Phase 9C adds production-grade observability with structured logging to answer "what happened and why?" when debugging sync issues.

### TraceSummary

Every pipeline run (watcher or orchestrator) generates a `TraceSummary` with:

- **requestId**: Unique identifier for tracing
- **source**: Origin (`watcher`, `feature-emit-marker`, `feature-emit-llm`)
- **parseMode**: How intents were extracted (`markers`, `llm`, `ast`)
- **intentsCount**: Number of intents found
- **opsCount**: Number of Figma operations generated
- **resolution**: Override/marker/ast precedence details
- **emit**: Whether operations were sent and to how many clients

### Example Trace Output

```
[Trace] requestId=feature-emit-1234 file=demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx parse=markers intents=4 ops=6
[Trace] resolution: override=2 marker=2 ast=0 code=2 map: used=true mappedOps=6
[Trace] emit: enabled=true sent=true clients=1 suppressedWatcher=true
```

### Trace Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TRACE` | `true` | Enable trace logging (human-readable) |
| `TRACE_JSON` | `false` | Output traces as JSON (for log aggregation) |
| `TRACE_VERBOSE` | `false` | Include detailed timings and resolution info |

### Usage

```bash
# Default human-readable traces
TRACE=true pnpm dev:watcher

# JSON output for log aggregation
TRACE_JSON=true pnpm dev:watcher

# Verbose mode with timing details
TRACE_VERBOSE=true pnpm dev:watcher
```

### Suppression Logging

The enhanced suppression system logs decisions:

```
[Trace] [suppression] demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx: SUPPRESSED (same-ops)
[Trace] [suppression] demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx: not suppressed (different-ops)
```

The ops-hash comparison prevents suppression of genuinely different changes that happen within the TTL window.

## Semantic Adapter Architecture (Phase 10A/10B/10C)

Phase 10A introduces a generic adapter system for extracting semantic intent from framework-specific UI components. Phase 10B adds the Ant Design adapter, proving the registry is framework-agnostic. Phase 10C adds read-only component map bootstrap suggestions, helping users bootstrap `component-map.json` for new projects. This allows the system to understand Vuetify, Ant Design, MUI, Chakra, and other UI frameworks without contaminating the core AST analysis pipeline.

### Supported Frameworks (Phase 10A/10B)

| Framework | Components | Detection | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Vuetify** | v-btn, v-card, v-text-field, v-chip | Tag name (`v-*`) | ✅ |
| **Ant Design** | Button, Input, Card, Tag | Import source (`antd`) | ✅ |
| MUI | - | - | Planned |
| Chakra UI | - | - | Planned |

### Vuetify Adapter

The Vuetify adapter extracts semantics from Vuetify's `v-*` components:

| Component | Extracted Semantics |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `v-btn` | color → fills, disabled, size, variant |
| `v-card` | width, height, title, subtitle, elevation |
| `v-text-field` | label → placeholder, disabled |
| `v-chip` | color → fills, variant |

### Ant Design Adapter (Phase 10B)

The Ant Design adapter uses **import-based detection** - components are only recognized if imported from `antd` or `antd/es/*`. This proves the adapter system is framework-agnostic.

| Component | Extracted Semantics |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `Button` | type → fills (antd:primary, etc.), danger, disabled, children |
| `Input` | placeholder, disabled |
| `Card` | title |
| `Tag` | color → fills (antd:color:green, etc.), children |

**Key Differences from Vuetify:**
- Uses **semantic hints** (`antd:primary`) instead of hex colors
- Detection via **import source**, not tag name
- PascalCase component names (Button, not v-btn)

### Component Map Suggestions (Phase 10C)

Phase 10C adds **read-only** suggestions for bootstrapping `component-map.json`. When analyzing a file, the system derives suggested entries based on AST anchors and adapter semantics.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **READ-ONLY**: Suggestions are printed to CLI only, no files are written
- **No Figma node IDs**: Code-only analysis, users must map to Figma manually
- **Explicit-only variant states**: Variant suggestions (`variantStatesSuggested`) are derived ONLY from explicit sources:
  - `@figma state=X` markers in code (e.g., `// @figma node="Button" state=hover`)
  - `design-overrides.json` keys with `::state` suffix (e.g., `"LoginButton::disabled"`)
  - **Never** inferred from semantics (disabled boolean, hover style hints, etc.)
- **Adapter-aware naming**: Uses framework metadata for better Figma name suggestions

**Example CLI Output:**
```
=== COMPONENT MAP SUGGESTIONS (READ-ONLY) ===
  NOTE: These suggestions are READ-ONLY. To use them, manually
  add entries to component-map.json or use Figma plugin "Send Selection".

  NEW (not in component-map.json):
    components/LoginButton
      → Suggested name: "Ant Design Button"
      → Variants: [hover]  (explicit: state=hover marker found)
      → Source: combined (antd)
      → Reason: Ant Design adapter: Button

    components/InfoCard
      → Suggested name: "Ant Design Card"
      → Variants: []
      → Source: combined (antd)
      → Reason: Ant Design adapter: Card

  Summary: 2 new, 0 existing, 0 skipped
```

**Suggestion Sources:**
| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ast-anchor` | Derived from AST analysis only, no adapter match |
| `combined` | AST anchor + adapter semantics |

### Component Map Bootstrap Artifacts (Phase 10D)

Phase 10D adds a **safe, review-first workflow** to bootstrap `component-map.json` from Phase 10C suggestions. It generates deterministic, auditable artifacts that humans can review before applying.

#### Why It Exists

- **Safe by default**: Generates review artifacts only, never auto-writes `component-map.json`
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs produce identical outputs (testable, auditable)
- **Explicit-only**: Respects Phase 10C rule — variant states from markers/overrides only
- **Never overwrites node IDs**: Existing Figma mappings are always preserved

#### How to Run

```bash
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher map:bootstrap demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
```

**Output:**
1. Writes artifact to: `design-materializations/<file>.component-map-bootstrap.json`
2. Prints terminal summary with counts and manual fields

#### Artifact Format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "generatedAt": "2025-12-20T12:00:00.000Z",
  "file": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
  "policy": {
    "variantStates": "explicit-only",
    "writes": "artifact-only"
  },
  "proposed": [
    {
      "componentKey": "auth/LoginButton",
      "figmaNameSuggestion": "Login Button",
      "variantStatesSuggested": ["hover"],
      "status": "new",
      "diff": {
        "before": null,
        "after": {
          "version": 2,
          "components": {
            "auth/LoginButton": {
              "figma": {
                "name": "Login Button",
                "componentSetNodeId": null,
                "variants": {
                  "base": { "nodeId": null },
                  "hover": { "nodeId": null }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "manualFields": [
        "figma.componentSetNodeId",
        "figma.variants.base.nodeId",
        "figma.variants.hover.nodeId"
      ],
      "reason": "AST anchor: LoginButton + Ant Design adapter"
    }
  ],
  "skipped": []
}
```

#### How to Use the Artifact

1. **Review proposed entries** in the artifact JSON
2. **Copy entries** you want into `component-map.json`
3. **Fill in node IDs** manually using Figma plugin "Send Selection"
4. The `manualFields` array tells you exactly what needs filling

#### Enable Apply Mode (Advanced)

To let the CLI merge entries into `component-map.json`:

```bash
# Dry run (shows what would change, doesn't modify)
MAP_BOOTSTRAP_MODE=apply pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher map:bootstrap demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# Actually apply (creates scaffolding, never fills node IDs)
MAP_BOOTSTRAP_MODE=apply MAP_BOOTSTRAP_DRY_RUN=false pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher map:bootstrap demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
```

**Environment Variables:**
| Variable | Values | Default | Description |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `MAP_BOOTSTRAP_MODE` | `artifact` \| `apply` | `artifact` | What to write |
| `MAP_BOOTSTRAP_DRY_RUN` | `true` \| `false` | `true` | Prevent actual writes |

#### What's Never Auto-Filled

Even in apply mode, these fields are **never** auto-filled:
- `figma.componentSetNodeId` — Requires Figma plugin
- `figma.variants.*.nodeId` — Requires Figma plugin
- Existing node IDs are **never overwritten**

#### Merge Rules

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| New component | Add entry with null nodeIds |
| Existing component, same config | Skip (already present) |
| Existing component, new variants | Add variant keys only |
| Existing component, different name | Mark as "manual decision required" |
| Existing nodeIds | **Never overwritten** |

---

### Canonical Token Layer (Phase 10E)

Phase 10E introduces a **design-system-agnostic semantic token layer** that normalizes adapter-specific values (Vuetify, Ant Design) and generic JSX values into portable canonical tokens.

#### Why It Exists

- **Cross-adapter portability**: Same canonical tokens regardless of UI library
- **Figma mapping consistency**: Canonical tokens → consistent Figma component mappings
- **Future MCP negotiation**: Standard vocabulary for AI-driven design token exchange
- **Observability**: Clear audit trail showing raw values → canonical tokens

#### Canonical Token Vocabulary

The canonical layer uses a hierarchical token naming convention:

```
color.primary      ← Vuetify "primary", AntD type="primary", hex #3B82F6
color.danger       ← Vuetify "error", AntD danger={true}
color.success      ← Vuetify "success", hex #10B981
color.warning      ← Vuetify "warning", hex #F59E0B
color.neutral.100  ← AntD type="default"

space.none         ← 0px
space.xs           ← 1-4px
space.sm           ← 5-8px
space.md           ← 9-16px
space.lg           ← 17-24px
space.xl           ← 25-32px
space.2xl          ← 33-48px
space.3xl          ← 49px+
```

#### How Normalization Works

```
┌──────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│  Adapter Semantics   │────▶│  Canonical Layer    │────▶│ Normalized Output│
│  (antd:primary)      │     │  (normalize.ts)     │     │ (color.primary)  │
└──────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
         ▲                            │
         │                            │ Hint Mappers
┌──────────────────────┐              │ (per-adapter)
│  Generic JSX         │              ▼
│  (#3B82F6)           │────▶ ┌───────────────────┐
└──────────────────────┘      │ Design Token Match│
                              │ (designTokens.ts) │
                              └───────────────────┘
```

1. **Adapter hints** → Look up in adapter-specific hint mapper
2. **Hex colors** → Check design tokens for known values
3. **Unknown values** → Preserved as raw + note generated

#### CLI Output

The `ast:report` command now shows canonical semantics:

CANONICAL SEMANTICS (Phase 10E)
============================================================
  LoginButton:
    fill: color.primary (confidence=high, source=vuetify)
      raw: #1976D2
  DisabledButton:
    fill: color.danger (confidence=high, source=vuetify)
      raw: #FF5252
  RegularButton:
    fill: color.primary (confidence=high, source=generic-jsx)
      raw: #3B82F6

  Summary: 7 canonical fields, 0 raw fields, 0 notes
```

#### Normalization Notes

When values can't be mapped to canonical tokens, notes explain why:

| Note Type | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `unmapped_color_hex` | Hex color not in design tokens |
| `unmapped_adapter_hint` | Adapter hint has no canonical mapping |
| `ambiguous_mapping` | Multiple possible canonical tokens |
| `raw_value_preserved` | Value kept as-is (informational) |

#### Extensibility: Custom Hint Mappers

Future adapters can register custom hint mappings:

```typescript
import { registerCanonicalHintMapper } from './tokens/canonical/index.js';

// Register MUI hint mapper
registerCanonicalHintMapper('mui', (hint: string) => {
  if (hint === 'mui:primary') return 'color.primary';
  if (hint === 'mui:error') return 'color.danger';
  return null;
});
```

#### Supported Mappings

**Vuetify → Canonical:**

| Vuetify | Canonical |
|---------|-----------|
| `primary` | `color.primary` |
| `secondary` | `color.secondary` |
| `success` | `color.success` |
| `error` | `color.danger` |
| `warning` | `color.warning` |
| `info` | `color.info` |
| `red`, `blue`, etc. | `color.red`, `color.blue`, etc. |

**Ant Design → Canonical:**

| AntD | Canonical |
|------|-----------|
| `antd:primary` | `color.primary` |
| `antd:danger` | `color.danger` |
| `antd:default` | `color.neutral.100` |
| `antd:link` | `color.primary` |

**Design Token Hex → Canonical:**

| Hex | Token Name | Canonical |
|-----|------------|-----------|
| `#3B82F6` | `Primary/Blue500` | `color.primary` |
| `#10B981` | `Success/Green500` | `color.success` |
| `#EF4444` | `Error/Red500` | `color.danger` |
| `#F59E0B` | `Warning/Yellow500` | `color.warning` |

#### Scope & Constraints

Phase 10E is **read-only** and does not:
- Modify JSX/TSX source files
- Write markers or overrides
- Emit Figma operations
- Change watcher sync behavior
- Affect server/plugin/protocol

---

### Canonical Resolver + Coverage Report (Phase 10F)

Phase 10F builds on the canonical layer (10E) by **resolving canonical tokens to concrete design system values** (hex colors, pixel measurements) and producing a **deterministic coverage report**.

#### Why It Exists

- **Bridge canonical → concrete**: Convert abstract tokens to actual values for Figma operations
- **Coverage visibility**: See exactly which canonical tokens resolve and which have gaps
- **Adapter-agnostic**: Same resolution logic for Vuetify, AntD, and generic JSX
- **Deterministic**: Same canonical input always produces same resolution output

#### How Resolution Works

```
┌──────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│  Canonical Semantics │────▶│  Canonical Resolver │────▶│  Resolved Values │
│  (color.primary)     │     │  (resolve.ts)       │     │  (#3B82F6)       │
└──────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
                                       │
                                       ▼
                              ┌──────────────────┐
                              │ Coverage Report  │
                              │ (totals, gaps)   │
                              └──────────────────┘
```

1. **Color resolution**: Canonical token → design token name → hex value
2. **Spacing resolution**: Canonical token → pixel value (8-point grid)
3. **Radius resolution**: Canonical token → pixel value
4. **Typography resolution**: Canonical token → fontSize/fontWeight values

#### CLI Output

The `ast:report` command now includes resolution and coverage:

```
============================================================
CANONICAL RESOLUTION (Phase 10F)
============================================================
  LoginButton:
    fill: color.primary → #3B82F6
  DisabledButton:
    fill: color.danger → #EF4444
  CardComponent:
    padding: space.lg → 24px
    borderRadius: radius.md → 8px

  Coverage: 4/4 resolved (100%)
```

When tokens cannot be resolved, notes explain why:

```
  UnknownComponent:
    fill: color.custom → (unresolved)
      ⚠ Canonical token "color.custom" not mapped to design system
    gap: space.weird → (unresolved)
      ⚠ Spacing token "space.weird" not found in scale

  Coverage: 0/2 resolved (0%)
```

#### Resolution Scales

**Spacing Scale (8-point grid):**

| Canonical | Pixels |
|-----------|--------|
| `space.none` | 0 |
| `space.xs` | 4 |
| `space.sm` | 8 |
| `space.md` | 16 |
| `space.lg` | 24 |
| `space.xl` | 32 |
| `space.2xl` | 48 |
| `space.3xl` | 64 |

**Radius Scale:**

| Canonical | Pixels |
|-----------|--------|
| `radius.none` | 0 |
| `radius.sm` | 4 |
| `radius.md` | 8 |
| `radius.lg` | 16 |
| `radius.full` | 9999 |

**Typography Scale:**

| Canonical | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `text.size.xs` | 12px |
| `text.size.sm` | 14px |
| `text.size.md` | 16px |
| `text.size.lg` | 18px |
| `text.size.xl` | 20px |
| `text.size.2xl` | 24px |
| `text.weight.light` | 300 |
| `text.weight.normal` | 400 |
| `text.weight.medium` | 500 |
| `text.weight.semibold` | 600 |
| `text.weight.bold` | 700 |

#### Coverage Report Structure

```typescript
interface CoverageReport {
  totals: {
    canonicalFields: number;  // Total fields analyzed
    resolved: number;         // Successfully resolved
    unresolved: number;       // Gaps (not resolved)
  };
  byCategory: {
    colors: CategoryCoverage;
    spacing: CategoryCoverage;
    radius: CategoryCoverage;
    typography: CategoryCoverage;
  };
  gaps: CoverageGap[];  // List of unresolved tokens with notes
}
```

#### Scope & Constraints

Phase 10F is **read-only** and does not:
- Modify JSX/TSX source files
- Write markers or overrides
- Emit Figma operations
- Change watcher sync behavior
- Affect server/plugin/protocol

---

### Resolution Policy + Project Coverage (Phase 10G)

Phase 10G adds **policy controls** and **project-level coverage reporting** for canonical resolution.

#### Why It Exists

- **Policy flexibility**: Different teams have different strictness requirements
- **CI integration**: Optional strict mode fails builds on policy violations
- **Project visibility**: Aggregate coverage across all source files
- **Actionable gaps**: See which canonical tokens need attention

#### CLI Command

```bash
# Scan a directory for TSX files
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher canonical:coverage src

# JSON output for automation
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher canonical:coverage src --json

# Strict mode (fails CI if violations exist)
CANONICAL_STRICT=true pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher canonical:coverage src
```

#### Environment Variables

| Variable | Values | Default | Description |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `CANONICAL_STRICT` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Enable strict mode (violations fail CI) |
| `CANONICAL_COLOR_STRATEGY` | `token-first`, `hex-allowed`, `token-only` | `token-first` | Color resolution policy |
| `CANONICAL_SPACING_SCALE` | `8pt`, `token-only`, `custom` | `8pt` | Spacing scale policy |
| `CANONICAL_RADIUS_SCALE` | `default`, `token-only`, `custom` | `default` | Radius scale policy |
| `CANONICAL_TYPOGRAPHY_SCALE` | `default`, `token-only`, `custom` | `default` | Typography scale policy |

#### Policy Strategies

**Color Strategies:**

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `token-first` | Prefer tokens, allow raw hex passthrough (default) |
| `hex-allowed` | Same as token-first, no violations for hex |
| `token-only` | Raw hex values are policy violations |

**Other Strategies:**

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `8pt` / `default` | Use default scales (default) |
| `token-only` | Only canonical tokens allowed, raw values are violations |
| `custom` | Use custom scale from config (future) |

#### CLI Output

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ℹ️  CI: strict mode disabled (violations are informational)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### CI Gate (Optional)

To enable strict mode in CI, add to your CI config:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Check canonical coverage
  run: |
    CANONICAL_STRICT=true pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher canonical:coverage src
```

This will fail the build if any policy violations exist.

#### Scope & Constraints

Phase 10G is **read-only** and does not:
- Modify JSX/TSX source files
- Write markers or overrides
- Emit Figma operations
- Change watcher sync behavior
- Affect server/plugin/protocol

---

### Figma Composition Suggestions (Phase 11A)

Phase 11A adds **read-only Figma composition guidance** that translates canonical design semantics into actionable suggestions for Figma.

This phase answers: **"Given what the code semantically expresses, what should exist in Figma?"**

It does NOT create anything—only describes it deterministically.

#### Suggestion Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `component-set` | Suggest creating a new Component Set | "Create LoginButton for componentKey auth/LoginButton" |
| `variant` | Suggest adding a variant (explicit-only) | "Component Set LoginButton should include variant hover" |
| `property` | Suggest Figma property mapping | "Component uses color.primary → map to Fill style" |
| `token-usage` | Suggest using design token | "Use token color.primary instead of hard-coded #3B82F6" |
| `coverage-gap` | Highlight missing coverage | "No spacing token resolved for space.xl" |

#### Suggestion Rules

**Component Set Suggestions**
- Component has canonical semantics
- Component NOT in component-map.json
- → Suggest creating a Component Set

**Variant Suggestions (Explicit Only)**
- ONLY from `@figma state=X` markers
- ONLY from `design-overrides.json ::state` keys
- NEVER inferred from disabled booleans or hover styles

**Property Suggestions**
- From canonical semantics:
  - color → Fill property
  - spacing → Auto Layout Gap/Padding
  - radius → Corner Radius
  - typography → Text Style

**Token Usage Suggestions**
- When canonical tokens resolve cleanly with high confidence
- Suggests using token instead of hard-coded values

**Coverage Gap Suggestions**
- From Phase 10F/10G gaps
- From policy violations

#### CLI Output

The `ast:report` command now includes Figma composition suggestions:

```
============================================================
FIGMA COMPOSITION SUGGESTIONS (Phase 11A)
============================================================
  [NEW COMPONENT SET]
    - Login Button (LoginButton)

  [VARIANTS]
    - LoginButton: [hover, disabled]

  [TOKEN USAGE]
    - Fill → color.primary
    - Auto Layout → space.md

  [PROPERTIES]
    - [LoginButton] Fill: color.primary
    - [Container] Auto Layout Gap: space.lg

  [COVERAGE GAPS]
    - Missing typography token for text.size.3xl

  Summary: 8 suggestions
    By type: 1 component-sets, 2 variants, 2 properties, 2 token-usage, 1 coverage-gaps
    By source: 7 canonical, 0 adapter, 1 policy, 0 coverage
```

#### Suggestion Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `canonical` | From canonical semantic normalization (Phase 10E) |
| `adapter` | From framework adapter semantics (Phase 10A) |
| `policy` | From resolution policy analysis (Phase 10G) |
| `coverage` | From coverage gap detection (Phase 10F) |

#### Scope & Constraints

Phase 11A is **read-only** and does NOT:
- Modify TSX/JSX source files
- Write markers or overrides
- Modify component-map.json
- Emit Figma operations
- Call materializers
- Change orchestrator behavior
- Change canonical normalization or resolution logic

---

## Figma Composition Application (Phase 11B)

Phase 11B transforms Phase 11A's read-only suggestions into actionable **compose operations** that can be applied to Figma with explicit opt-in and full audit logging.

### Overview

Building on Phase 11A suggestions, this phase provides:

1. **Compose Operations** - Deterministic, auditable operations for Figma modifications
2. **Opt-In Apply Mode** - Dry-run by default, apply only with explicit flags
3. **Feature Flags** - Fine-grained control over what can be composed
4. **Audit Trail** - Full logging of all compose operations to sync-log.md
5. **CLI Integration** - `figma:compose` command for automation

### Compose Operation Types

| Type | Description | Payload |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `ENSURE_COMPONENT_SET` | Create missing Component Set | `{ name }` |
| `ENSURE_VARIANT` | Add variant to Component Set | `{ setName, variantProps }` |
| `ENSURE_PROPERTY_DEF` | Define property on Component Set | `{ setName, propertyName, propertyType, defaultValue? }` |

### Feature Flags

| Flag | Values | Default | Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `FIGMA_COMPOSE_ON` | `true`/`false` | `false` | Master enable switch |
| `FIGMA_COMPOSE_MODE` | `off`/`dry-run`/`apply` | `off` | Execution mode |
| `FIGMA_COMPOSE_ALLOW` | comma-separated | (all allowed) | Operation type allow-list |
| `FIGMA_COMPOSE_SERVER` | URL | `http://localhost:3001` | Server endpoint |

**Allow-list values:** `component-set`, `variant`, `property`

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Generate compose artifact (dry-run, no Figma changes)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:compose demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# Apply operations to Figma (requires FIGMA_COMPOSE_ON=true, server + plugin running)
FIGMA_COMPOSE_ON=true FIGMA_COMPOSE_MODE=apply \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:compose demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply

# Restrict to only component-set operations
FIGMA_COMPOSE_ALLOW=component-set \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:compose demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply
```

### Compose Artifact

Artifacts are written to `design-materializations/` with naming:

```
<file-path>.compose.json
```

Example artifact structure:

```json
{
  "sourceFile": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
  "generatedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "mode": "dry-run",
  "operations": [
    {
      "opId": "abc123def",
      "type": "ENSURE_COMPONENT_SET",
      "componentKey": "PrimaryButton",
      "figmaName": "PrimaryButton",
      "payload": { "name": "PrimaryButton" },
      "reason": "Component in code missing from component-map",
      "source": "figma-suggestions"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 1,
    "byType": { "ENSURE_COMPONENT_SET": 1 }
  }
}
```

### Deterministic Operation IDs

Each operation receives a deterministic `opId` generated via djb2 hash of:
- Operation type
- Component key
- Figma name
- Stringified payload

This ensures:
- **Idempotency** - Same inputs produce same opId
- **Deduplication** - Operations can be compared across runs
- **Traceability** - Operations can be tracked through the system

### Server Endpoint

The `/compose` endpoint accepts compose artifacts:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/compose \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @design-materializations/demos__react-demo-app__src__App.compose.json
```

The endpoint:
1. Validates the artifact structure
2. Logs the request to sync-log.md via `logCompose()`
3. Broadcasts `COMPOSE_OPERATIONS` to connected Figma plugins
4. Returns the number of operations dispatched

### Plugin Behavior

When the Figma plugin receives `COMPOSE_OPERATIONS`:

1. **ENSURE_COMPONENT_SET** - Searches for existing Component Set by name, creates if missing using `combineAsVariants()`
2. **ENSURE_VARIANT** - Finds target Component Set, checks for existing variant by props, adds if missing
3. **ENSURE_PROPERTY_DEF** - Adds component property definition if not present

The plugin returns `COMPOSE_RESULT` with per-operation success/failure status.

### Audit Logging

All compose operations are logged to sync-log.md:

```markdown
| 2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z | compose | demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx | dry-run | 3 ops | ENSURE_COMPONENT_SET,ENSURE_VARIANT |
```

Fields logged:
- Timestamp
- Event type (`compose`)
- Source file
- Mode (`dry-run` or `apply`)
- Operation count
- Operation types

### Safety Guarantees

1. **Dry-run by default** - No Figma changes without explicit `--apply` flag
2. **Master switch** - `FIGMA_COMPOSE_ON` must be `true` for server dispatch
3. **Allow-list** - `FIGMA_COMPOSE_ALLOW` restricts operation types
4. **Idempotent** - Operations check for existing elements before creating
5. **Auditable** - Full trail in sync-log.md and compose artifacts

---

## Figma Property Application (Phase 11C)

Phase 11C applies resolved canonical semantics (from Phase 10F/10G) to existing Figma structures. Unlike Phase 11B which creates new Component Sets and variants, this phase **only applies properties** to nodes that already exist.

### Overview

Building on the canonical resolution pipeline:

1. **Property Application** - Apply colors, spacing, and typography to existing nodes
2. **Explicit Targeting** - Only nodes with stable IDs in component-map.json
3. **Category Allow-List** - Fine-grained control over property types
4. **Opt-In Apply Mode** - Artifact-only by default
5. **Audit Trail** - Full logging of all apply operations
6. **Variant-Aware Targeting** - Ops target variant nodeIds, never Component Sets (Phase 11C.1)
7. **Text-Descendant Resolution** - Text props auto-resolve to TEXT node descendants (Phase 11C.1)

### Variant-Aware Targeting (Phase 11C.1)

Apply operations target the correct variant nodeId rather than the Component Set:

- **Component Sets** are containers and should never receive visual properties directly
- When `ComponentKey::state` is specified (e.g., `LoginButton::hover`), the variant nodeId for that state is used
- `getVariantNodeId(componentMap, componentKey, state?)` returns `{ nodeId, state, fromVariant }`
- If no variant exists for the requested state, a `missing-variant-id` violation is created (no fallback to Component Set)
- State name fallback: `base` ↔ `default` for compatibility

### Text-Descendant Resolution (Phase 11C.1)

Text properties (`fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `textColor`) require a TEXT node, but apply ops often target containers:

- **Plugin auto-resolution**: `findTextDescendant(node)` finds the first TEXT node within a container (depth-first)
- If the target node is not a TEXT node, the plugin searches for a TEXT descendant
- Console logs show which TEXT node was actually modified: `Applied fontSize to TEXT node 23:45 (target was 23:27)`
- Falls back gracefully if no TEXT node is found

### Property Types

| Property | Category | Figma Operation |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| `fill` | fill | Set background/foreground color |
| `textColor` | fill | Set text fill color |
| `padding` | spacing | Set Auto Layout padding |
| `gap` | spacing | Set Auto Layout item spacing |
| `width` | spacing | Set node width (if already defined) |
| `height` | spacing | Set node height (if already defined) |
| `fontSize` | typography | Set text font size |
| `fontWeight` | typography | Set text font weight |

### Feature Flags

| Flag | Values | Default | Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `FIGMA_APPLY_ON` | `true`/`false` | `false` | Master enable switch |
| `FIGMA_APPLY_MODE` | `artifact`/`apply` | `artifact` | Execution mode |
| `FIGMA_APPLY_DRY_RUN` | `true`/`false` | `true` | Dry-run mode (apply only) |
| `FIGMA_APPLY_ALLOW` | comma-separated | (none) | Property category allow-list |
| `FIGMA_APPLY_SERVER` | URL | `http://localhost:3001` | Server endpoint |
| `FIGMA_APPLY_MIN_CONFIDENCE` | `low`/`medium`/`high` | `high` | Minimum confidence threshold |

**Allow-list values:** `fill`, `spacing`, `typography`

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Generate apply artifact (artifact-only, no Figma changes)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# Apply properties to Figma (requires full opt-in)
FIGMA_APPLY_ON=true FIGMA_APPLY_MODE=apply FIGMA_APPLY_DRY_RUN=false \
  FIGMA_APPLY_ALLOW=fill,spacing \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply

# Verbose output
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --verbose
```

### Apply Artifact

Artifacts are written to `design-materializations/` with naming:

```
<file-path>.figma-apply.json
```

Example artifact structure:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "sourceFile": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
  "mode": "artifact",
  "dryRun": true,
  "operations": [
    {
      "opId": "apply-abc123",
      "nodeId": "CS:btn-123",
      "componentKey": "Button",
      "property": "fill",
      "to": "#3498db",
      "canonicalSource": "color.primary.500",
      "confidence": "high",
      "source": "canonical-resolution",
      "reason": "Apply resolved color color.primary.500"
    }
  ],
  "violations": [
    {
      "type": "property-not-allowed",
      "componentKey": "Card",
      "property": "padding",
      "message": "Property category 'spacing' not in FIGMA_APPLY_ALLOW"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "totalOperations": 1,
    "byProperty": { "fill": 1 },
    "totalViolations": 1,
    "byViolationType": { "property-not-allowed": 1 }
  }
}
```

### Policy Violations

Operations may be rejected for several reasons:

| Violation Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `missing-node-id` | Node not found in component-map.json |
| `property-not-allowed` | Property category not in FIGMA_APPLY_ALLOW |
| `no-canonical-source` | No canonical token for this property |
| `low-confidence` | Confidence below FIGMA_APPLY_MIN_CONFIDENCE |
| `value-unchanged` | Current value matches target (idempotency) |

### Server Endpoint

The `/apply-properties` endpoint accepts apply operations:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/apply-properties \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"operations": [...], "mode": "apply"}'
```

The endpoint:
1. Validates the request
2. Logs to sync-log.md via `logApplyProperties()`
3. In dry-run mode: returns operations without sending to plugin
4. In apply mode: broadcasts `APPLY_PROPERTIES` to connected plugins
5. Returns operation results

### Plugin Behavior

When the Figma plugin receives `APPLY_PROPERTIES`:

1. **Locate Node** - Uses `figma.getNodeById()` with the nodeId
2. **Validate Node Type** - Ensures node supports the property
3. **Apply Property** - Sets the appropriate property value:
   - `fill`: Sets fills array with solid color
   - `textColor`: Sets fills on TextNode
   - `padding/gap`: Sets Auto Layout properties
   - `fontSize/fontWeight`: Sets text style properties
4. **Return Result** - Reports success/failure per operation

The plugin returns `APPLY_PROPERTIES_RESULT` with per-operation status.

### Audit Logging

Apply operations are logged to sync-log.md:

```markdown
| 2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z | apply-properties | demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx | apply | 3 ops | fill(2),fontSize(1) |
```

### Safety Guarantees

1. **Artifact-only by default** - Mode defaults to 'artifact'
2. **Dry-run by default** - FIGMA_APPLY_DRY_RUN defaults to true
3. **Master switch** - FIGMA_APPLY_ON must be true for server dispatch
4. **Category allow-list** - FIGMA_APPLY_ALLOW restricts property types
5. **Explicit targeting only** - Only nodes in component-map.json
6. **Confidence threshold** - FIGMA_APPLY_MIN_CONFIDENCE filters low-confidence
7. **Idempotent** - Repeated runs produce same opIds, no duplicate changes
8. **Auditable** - Full trail in sync-log.md and apply artifacts

### Differences from Phase 11B

| Aspect | Phase 11B (Compose) | Phase 11C (Apply) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Purpose | Create new structure | Apply properties to existing |
| Target | Missing Component Sets/Variants | Existing nodes with stable IDs |
| Operations | ENSURE_* | Property assignments |
| Allow-list | Operation types | Property categories |
| Creates nodes | Yes | No |

## Guided Conflict Resolution (Phase 12D/12E)

Phase 12D/12E introduces a guided resolution layer that surfaces conflicts between Figma and code, then proposes explicit, auditable resolution plans.

### Key Principles

- **No automatic resolution** - Plans are proposals, not executions
- **No silent writes** - All changes require explicit approval
- **No inference beyond existing policy** - Uses same rules as Phase 12B/12C
- **Everything explicit, reviewable, and reversible**

### Conflict Types (Phase 12D)

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `AST_VS_FIGMA` | AST literal differs from Figma value |
| `MARKER_VS_FIGMA` | Marker attribute differs from Figma value |
| `OVERRIDE_VS_FIGMA` | Override entry differs from Figma value |
| `CANONICAL_MISMATCH` | Raw values match but canonical tokens differ |
| `UNMAPPED_VARIANT` | Variant nodeId not found in component map |
| `NON_BASE_STATE_BLOCKED` | Non-base state without explicit data |
| `LOW_CONFIDENCE_BLOCKED` | Delta confidence too low for auto-apply |

### Resolution Actions (Phase 12E)

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `APPLY_TO_AST` | Write value directly to AST literal |
| `APPLY_TO_MARKER` | Update @figma marker line |
| `APPLY_TO_OVERRIDE` | Write to design-overrides.json |
| `IGNORE` | Skip this conflict (user must decide) |
| `BLOCK` | Cannot resolve automatically |

### Default Resolution Rules

| Conflict Scenario | Default Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| AST auto-writable base state | APPLY_TO_AST |
| Non-base state with explicit marker | APPLY_TO_MARKER |
| Non-base state with existing override | APPLY_TO_OVERRIDE |
| Non-base state, no explicit data | BLOCK |
| Unsafe AST write | APPLY_TO_OVERRIDE |
| Canonical mismatch | IGNORE |
| Low confidence | BLOCK |

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Generate resolution plan for a file
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# Full report including conflict preview (in ast:report)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher ast:report demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
```

### CLI Output

```
=== CONFLICT RESOLUTION PLAN (Phase 12E) ===

  Component: LoginButton
  State: hover

    Property: fill
    Conflict: LoginButton::hover::fill
    Suggested Resolution: APPLY_TO_MARKER
    Reason: Non-base state (hover) with explicit marker present

  Summary:
    - Apply to AST: 1
    - Apply to Marker: 2
    - Apply to Override: 0
    - Ignored: 1
    - Blocked: 1

  Resolution plan written to:
    design-materializations/demos__react-demo-app__src__App.figma-resolution-plan.json
```

### Artifact Files

| File Pattern | Phase | Content |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| `*.figma-conflicts.json` | 12D | Conflict analysis with evidence |
| `*.figma-resolution-plan.json` | 12E | Resolution decisions with reasons |

### Example Resolution Plan Artifact

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "source": "figma-resolution-plan",
  "generatedAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "sourceFile": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
  "summary": {
    "applyAst": 1,
    "applyMarker": 2,
    "applyOverride": 0,
    "ignored": 0,
    "blocked": 1
  },
  "decisions": [
    {
      "componentKey": "LoginButton",
      "targetState": "base",
      "property": "fill",
      "action": "APPLY_TO_AST",
      "reason": "Base state with auto-writable fill literal in AST",
      "sourceConflictId": "LoginButton::base::fill"
    }
  ]
}
```

### What Phase 12E Does NOT Do

- **Does NOT modify TSX/JSX** - Resolution plans are proposals only
- **Does NOT modify markers** - No automatic marker updates
- **Does NOT modify design-overrides.json** - No override writes
- **Does NOT emit Figma operations** - Read-only analysis
- **Does NOT apply changes** - Phase 12F is the executor

---

## Apply Resolution Plans (Phase 12F)

Phase 12F provides the controlled execution layer that takes Phase 12E resolution plans and applies them to the correct targets.

### Key Principles

- **Artifact-only by default** - No mutations without explicit opt-in
- **Multi-flag gate** - Requires all three flags: ON + MODE=apply + DRY_RUN=false
- **Allow-list enforcement** - Only enabled targets can be written
- **Non-base state AST blocking** - Hover/pressed/disabled states never get AST writes
- **Deterministic execution** - Same plan → same operations → same artifacts
- **Full traceability** - Decision IDs link artifacts to source conflicts

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Values | Description |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_ON` | `false` | `true`/`false` | Master switch |
| `FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_MODE` | `artifact` | `artifact`/`apply` | Artifact-only or apply |
| `FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_DRY_RUN` | `true` | `true`/`false` | Dry-run mode |
| `FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_ALLOW` | `ast,marker,override` | CSV list | Allowed targets |
| `FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_MIN_CONFIDENCE` | `high` | `low`/`medium`/`high` | Min confidence |
| `FIGMA_RESOLVE_PLAN_PATH` | (auto) | File path | Custom plan path |

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Preview what would be applied (artifact-only, default)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# Apply with explicit flags (still respects env var gates)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply

# Full apply (all flags enabled)
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_ON=true FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_MODE=apply FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_DRY_RUN=false \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply

# Apply from custom plan artifact
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx \
  --from .aesthetic-function/artifacts/my-custom-plan.json

# Filter by component or state
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx \
  --component LoginButton --state base
```

### Apply Result Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `applied` | Successfully written to target |
| `noop` | Target already matches intended value |
| `skipped` | Skipped due to IGNORE/BLOCK or filter |
| `blocked` | Policy/precondition prevented apply |
| `failed` | Attempted but errored |

### Professional Runbook

```

### Artifact Files

| File Pattern | Phase | Content |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| `*.figma-resolution-plan.json` | 12E | Resolution decisions with reasons |
| `*.figma-resolve-apply.json` | 12F | Apply results with decision IDs |

### Example Apply Artifact

## Post-Apply Verification (Phase 12G)

Phase 12G provides the verification layer that confirms whether applied resolution plans landed as intended.

### Key Principles

- **Verification-only** - No mutations, only observes and records
- **Apply ≠ Trust** - System proves it did what it claimed
- **Detect drift** - Identifies partial failures or external changes
- **CI-safe** - Exit codes suitable for CI gates
- **Rollback preparation** - Captures previous values for future use

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Values | Description |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `FIGMA_VERIFY_INCLUDE_FIGMA` | `false` | `true`/`false` | Include Figma verification (read-only) |
| `FIGMA_VERIFY_ALWAYS_WRITE_ARTIFACT` | `false` | `true`/`false` | Write artifact even on success |
| `FIGMA_SERVER_URL` | `http://localhost:3001` | URL | Server for Figma queries |

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Verify most recent apply (auto-discovers artifacts)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:verify demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# Verify specific apply artifact
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:verify demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx \
  --apply-artifact .aesthetic-function/artifacts/demos/react-demo-app/App.figma-resolve-apply.json

# Always write verification artifact (even on success)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:verify demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --always-write

# Include Figma verification (requires server running)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:verify demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --include-figma
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | CI Behavior |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 0 | All verified or skipped | Pass |
| 1 | Any mismatch, missing, or blocked | Fail |

### Verification Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `verified` | Actual value matches expected |
| `mismatch` | Values differ (drift detected) |
| `missing` | Target not found (file, marker, or override) |
| `skipped` | Verification not applicable |
| `blocked` | Could not verify (network error, etc.) |

### Verification Targets

| Target | What is Verified |
|--------|------------------|
| `ast` | Re-read source file and check JSX value at expected location |
| `marker` | Parse markers and verify property value |
| `override` | Parse design-overrides.json and check property |
| `figma` | Query Figma server for current value (optional) |

### Professional Runbook

Complete workflow with verification:

```bash
# 1. Generate and apply resolution plan
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_ON=true \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_MODE=apply \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_DRY_RUN=false \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply

# 2. Verify the apply succeeded
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:verify demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# 3. Check verification artifact if failures
cat .aesthetic-function/artifacts/demos/react-demo-app/App.figma-verification.json

# 4. Use in CI (exit code gates the build)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:verify demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx || exit 1
```

### Artifact Files

| File Pattern | Phase | Content |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| `*.figma-resolve-apply.json` | 12F | Apply results with decision IDs |
| `*.figma-verification.json` | 12G | Verification results with evidence |

### Example Verification Artifact

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "file": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",

## Post-Apply Auto-Verification + CI Gate (Phase 12H)

Phase 12H introduces an orchestration layer that automatically runs verification after apply operations when explicitly enabled. This creates a seamless apply → verify → exit-code pipeline for CI integration.

### Key Principles

- **Orchestration + Policy only** - No new mutation capabilities beyond Phase 12F
- **Opt-in via environment variable** - Nothing changes unless explicitly enabled
- **CI-safe** - Clear exit semantics for CI gates
- **Artifact linking** - Bidirectional linking between apply and verification artifacts

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Values | Description |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `POST_APPLY_VERIFY` | `false` | `true`/`false` | Enable automatic verification after apply |
| `POST_APPLY_VERIFY_INCLUDE_FIGMA` | `false` | `true`/`false` | Include Figma verification (read-only) |
| `POST_APPLY_VERIFY_STRICT` | `true` | `true`/`false` | Exit 1 on mismatch/missing (CI gate) |

### When Verification Runs

Verification only runs when **all** conditions are met:

1. `POST_APPLY_VERIFY=true`
2. `FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_MODE=apply` (not artifact-only)
3. `FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_DRY_RUN=false` (actual mutations occurred)

If any condition is not met, verification is skipped with exit code 0.

### Exit Codes

| Scenario | Exit Code | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Verification passed | 0 | All items verified or skipped |
| Verification not enabled | 0 | POST_APPLY_VERIFY=false |
| Artifact-only mode | 0 | Mode is 'artifact', no verification |
| Dry-run mode | 0 | DRY_RUN=true, no verification |
| Strict mode + mismatch | 1 | Found mismatches with strict=true |
| Strict mode + missing | 1 | Found missing targets with strict=true |
| Non-strict mode + failure | 0 | Advisory only, no CI failure |

### CLI Usage

Post-apply verification integrates seamlessly with `figma:resolve-apply`:

```bash
# Apply without verification (default)
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_ON=true \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_MODE=apply \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_DRY_RUN=false \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply

# Apply WITH automatic verification (CI mode)
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_ON=true \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_MODE=apply \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_DRY_RUN=false \
POST_APPLY_VERIFY=true \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply

# Apply with verification but don't fail CI on mismatches (advisory)
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_ON=true \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_MODE=apply \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_DRY_RUN=false \
POST_APPLY_VERIFY=true \
POST_APPLY_VERIFY_STRICT=false \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply

# Include Figma verification (requires server)
POST_APPLY_VERIFY=true \
POST_APPLY_VERIFY_INCLUDE_FIGMA=true \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply
```

### Artifact Linking

When post-apply verification runs, artifacts are linked:

**Apply Artifact** includes verification path:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "source": "figma-resolution-apply",
  "verificationArtifactPath": "design-materializations/src__App.figma-verification.json",
  ...
}
```

**Verification Artifact** includes apply path:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "source": "figma-verification",
  "applyArtifactPath": "design-materializations/src__App.figma-resolve-apply.json",
  ...
}
```

### CI Integration Example

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
jobs:
  sync-design:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Apply resolution plan with verification
        run: |
          FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_ON=true \
          FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_MODE=apply \
          FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_DRY_RUN=false \
          POST_APPLY_VERIFY=true \
          POST_APPLY_VERIFY_STRICT=true \
            pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply src/App.tsx --apply
        # CI will fail if verification finds mismatches

      - name: Upload verification artifacts
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: verification-report
          path: design-materializations/*.figma-verification.json
```

### CLI Output

When verification runs:

```
--- Post-Apply Verification (Phase 12H) ---
  enabled:      YES
  includeFigma: NO
  strict:       YES (exit 1 on mismatch)

POST-APPLY VERIFICATION
=======================
  Status: PASSED ✓

  ✓ Verified: 5
  ⚠ Mismatch: 0
  ✗ Missing:  0
  ⏭ Skipped:  1
  ⊘ Blocked:  0

  Artifact: design-materializations/src__App.figma-verification.json

  Exit Code: 0
```

When verification is skipped:

```
--- Post-Apply Verification (Phase 12H) ---
  Status: SKIPPED
  Reason: POST_APPLY_VERIFY is not enabled
```

---

## Rollback Preview & Safety Envelope (Phase 12I)

Phase 12I introduces a read-only rollback preview layer that shows exactly what would be undone if a verification failure were to trigger a rollback — without performing any rollback.

This phase completes the safety triangle:

**Apply → Verify → Rollback Preview**

Rollback execution itself is explicitly out of scope.

### Key Principles

- **Read-only only** - No mutations, only observes and records
- **Deterministic** - Same inputs → same outputs
- **Explicit** - No automatic behavior
- **Diagnostic** - Improves human confidence and CI auditability
- **Always exit 0** - Never fails CI (purely informational)

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Generate rollback preview (auto-discovers artifacts)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:rollback-preview demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# Use specific artifact paths
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:rollback-preview demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx \
  --apply-artifact design-materializations/custom-apply.json \
  --verify-artifact design-materializations/custom-verify.json
```

### CLI Output

```
=== ROLLBACK PREVIEW (Phase 12I) ===

LoginButton::hover
  fill:
    applied  → #00FF00
    previous → #2563EB
    target   → override
    reason   → mismatch

Summary:
  Total rollback actions: 1
  Targets: override (1)
```

When no rollback is needed:

```
=== ROLLBACK PREVIEW (Phase 12I) ===

No rollback actions needed.
All verification items passed or were skipped.
```

### Rollback Preview Artifact

Pattern: `design-materializations/<file>.figma-rollback-preview.json`

Only written when rollback actions exist.

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "source": "figma-rollback-preview",
  "sourceFile": "src/App.tsx",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "applyArtifactPath": "design-materializations/src__App.figma-resolve-apply.json",
  "verificationArtifactPath": "design-materializations/src__App.figma-verification.json",
  "actions": [
    {
      "actionId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8",
      "target": "override",
      "componentKey": "LoginButton",
      "targetState": "hover",
      "property": "fill",
      "appliedValue": "#00FF00",
      "previousValue": "#2563EB",
      "sourceApplyOpId": "x1y2z3w4...",
      "verificationStatus": "mismatch",
      "reason": "Verification mismatch: expected #00FF00, observed #FF0000"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 1,
    "byTarget": { "override": 1 },
    "byProperty": { "fill": 1 }
  }
}
```

### Professional Runbook

Complete workflow with rollback preview:

```bash
# 1. Generate and apply resolution plan
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_ON=true \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_MODE=apply \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_DRY_RUN=false \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply

# 2. Verify the apply succeeded
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:verify demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# 3. If verification failed, preview what would be rolled back
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:rollback-preview demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# 4. Review rollback preview artifact
cat design-materializations/demos__react-demo-app__src__App.figma-rollback-preview.json
```

### Safety Triangle

| Phase | Purpose | Exit Code |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 12F: Apply | Execute resolution plan | 0 or 1 |
| 12G: Verify | Confirm apply succeeded | 0 or 1 |
| 12I: Rollback Preview | Show what would be undone | Always 0 |
| 12J: Status | Summarize reconciliation lifecycle | 0 (PASS/WARN) or 1 (FAIL) |

---

## Reconciliation Status Artifact (Phase 12J)

Phase 12J completes the reconciliation lifecycle by producing a single, deterministic, human- and CI-readable artifact summarizing the end-to-end reconciliation state for any source file.

### Key Question

**"What is the reconciliation status of this file, right now?"**

The `figma:status` command answers this by:
1. Auto-discovering artifacts from Phases 12F-12I
2. Computing status using a fixed rule-table (no heuristics)
3. Producing a deterministic verdict and exit code

### Status Values

| OverallStatus | Meaning | CiVerdict | Exit Code |
|---------------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `CLEAN` | No reconciliation artifacts found | PASS | 0 |
| `APPLIED_UNVERIFIED` | Apply attempted, verification not run | WARN | 0 |
| `VERIFIED_OK` | Apply + verification both succeeded | PASS | 0 |
| `VERIFY_FAILED` | Verification failed, no rollback preview | FAIL | 1 |
| `ROLLBACK_AVAILABLE` | Verification failed, rollback preview exists | FAIL | 1 |
| `INCOMPLETE` | Missing or inconsistent artifacts | WARN | 0 |

### Status Determination Rules

| Condition | overallStatus | ciVerdict |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| No apply, no deltas | CLEAN | PASS |
| Apply attempted, no verify | APPLIED_UNVERIFIED | WARN |
| Apply + verify success | VERIFIED_OK | PASS |
| Verify failed, rollback preview exists | ROLLBACK_AVAILABLE | FAIL |
| Verify failed, no rollback preview | VERIFY_FAILED | FAIL |
| Missing or inconsistent artifacts | INCOMPLETE | WARN |

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Check status of a file
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:status demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# JSON output
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:status demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --json

# Write status artifact (only if non-CLEAN)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:status demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --write
```

### Example Output

```
✅ Reconciliation Status: ✓ VERIFIED_OK

Source: demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
Timestamp: 2025-01-15T12:00:00.000Z

Phases:
  • Apply: ✓ 5 operation(s)
  • Verify: ✓ 0 mismatch(es), 0 missing
  • Rollback Preview: not generated

Explanation: Apply succeeded and verification passed.

CI Verdict: PASS
Exit Code: 0
```

### Status Artifact

When `--write` is provided and status is non-CLEAN:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "sourceFile": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "phases": {
    "apply": {
      "attempted": true,
      "dryRun": false,
      "success": true,
      "operationCount": 5
    },
    "verify": {
      "attempted": true,
      "success": true,
      "mismatchCount": 0,
      "missingCount": 0
    }
  },
  "overallStatus": "VERIFIED_OK",
  "ciVerdict": "PASS",
  "explanation": "Apply succeeded and verification passed."
}
```

### Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate and apply resolution plan
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_ON=true \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_MODE=apply \
FIGMA_RESOLVE_APPLY_DRY_RUN=false \
  pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:resolve-apply demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --apply

# 2. Verify the apply succeeded
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:verify demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# 3. If verification failed, preview what would be rolled back
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:rollback-preview demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# 4. Get comprehensive status summary
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:status demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --write

# 5. Use status exit code in CI
if pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:status demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx; then
  echo "Reconciliation OK"
else
  echo "Reconciliation FAILED - review status artifact"
fi
```

### CI Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/figma-reconciliation.yml
- name: Check Reconciliation Status
  run: |
    pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:status ${{ matrix.file }} --write
  # Exit 1 on FAIL verdict, 0 on PASS/WARN
```

### Guarantees

- **Deterministic**: Same artifacts → same status, always
- **Rule-table only**: No heuristics, no inference
- **Read-only**: Reads artifacts, never mutates them
- **Single artifact**: One status file per source file
- **CI-friendly**: Exit codes map directly to verdict

### Non-Goals (Explicit)

- ❌ Executing rollback
- ❌ Auto-rollback
- ❌ Background watchers
- ❌ Implicit behavior
- ❌ Any mutation

## Reconciliation Run Index (Phase 13A)

Phase 13A provides a single, deterministic "run index" artifact that summarizes what reconciliation artifacts exist for a given source file and their key metadata. This is **NOT** a timeline/history feature (that is Phase 13B). This phase is one-shot indexing of current/latest artifacts.

### Key Question

**"What reconciliation artifacts exist for this file, and what are their key details?"**

The `figma:index` command answers this by:
1. Auto-discovering all artifacts from Phases 12A-12J
2. Extracting key metadata (timestamps, modes, counts)
3. Producing a deterministic, sorted index

### Indexed Artifact Types

| Artifact Type | Phase | File Pattern |
|---------------|-------|--------------|
| delta | 12A | `*.figma-delta.json` |
| deltaSuggestions | 12B | `*.figma-delta-suggestions.json` |
| conflicts | 12D | `*.figma-conflicts.json` |
| resolutionPlan | 12E | `*.figma-resolution-plan.json` |
| resolutionApply | 12F | `*.figma-resolution-apply.json` |
| verification | 12G | `*.figma-verification.json` |
| rollbackPreview | 12I | `*.figma-rollback-preview.json` |
| status | 12J | `*.figma-reconciliation-status.json` |

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Index artifacts for a file
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:index demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# JSON output
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:index demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --json

# Write run index artifact
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:index demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --write

# Verbose mode (show discovery paths)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:index demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --verbose
```

### Example Output

```
=== FIGMA RUN INDEX (Phase 13A) ===
Repo Root: /path/to/repo
Source: demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx (canonical)

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "repoRoot": "/abs/path/to/repo",
  "sourceFile": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",

    },
    "verification": { "found": false },
    "rollbackPreview": { "found": false },
    "status": { "found": false }
  },
  "notes": []
}
```

### Summary Fields by Artifact Type

| Artifact | Summary Fields |
|----------|----------------|
| delta | `deltas` |
| deltaSuggestions | `suggestions` |
| conflicts | `conflicts`, `blocked` |
| resolutionPlan | `decisions` |
| resolutionApply | `ops`, `dryRun`, `applied`, `skipped`, `failed` |
| verification | `verified`, `mismatch`, `missing` |
| rollbackPreview | `actions` |
| status | `overallStatus`, `ciVerdict` |

### Best-Candidate Selection

If multiple matching artifacts exist for a type (e.g., legacy and current naming):
1. Prefer canonical current naming
2. If still multiple, pick newest by timestamp inside artifact
3. Fallback to file mtime if timestamp field missing
4. Log a warning in `notes` array

### Repo-Root Invariance

The command behaves identically when run from:
- Repository root
- `packages/watcher`
- Any subdirectory

All input paths (relative, `../`, absolute) normalize to the same canonical form.

### Relation to Other Phases

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 12J: Status | Single lifecycle status (CLEAN, VERIFIED_OK, etc.) |
| 13A: Index | Snapshot of all artifact presence + metadata |
| 13B: Timeline (future) | Historical run-over-run tracking |

### Guarantees

- **Deterministic**: Same artifacts → same index output, always
- **Read-only**: Never generates, applies, or mutates artifacts
- **Repo-root invariant**: Works identically from any working directory
- **Single artifact**: One index file per source file
- **Always exit 0**: Read-only indexing never fails CI

---

## Design Drift Timeline (Phase 13B)

Phase 13B turns the one-shot index from Phase 13A into **longitudinal history**. Every reconciliation command run (apply, verify, resolve-apply, etc.) is recorded as an immutable entry in an append-only ledger.

### Key Question

**"What reconciliation runs have occurred for this file over time, and what was the artifact state at each run?"**

This enables:
- **Drift detection**: Tracking how design/code synchronization evolves
- **Debugging**: Understanding what happened before a failure
- **Audit trails**: Recording who/what/when for compliance

### Feature Flag

Recording is **off by default** and gated by:

```bash
RECONCILIATION_TIMELINE_ON=true
```

When enabled, runs are automatically recorded after successful completion of:
- `figma:apply`
- `figma:verify`
- `figma:resolve-apply`
- `figma:rollback-preview`
- `figma:status`
- `figma:index`

### Run Ledger Artifact

Pattern: `design-materializations/<file>.figma-run-ledger.json`

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "sourceFile": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
  "runs": [
    {
      "runId": "abc12345",
      "sourceFile": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
      "timestamp": "2025-12-30T10:00:00.000Z",
      "cwd": "/repo",
      "repoRoot": "/repo",
      "command": "figma:status",
      "artifacts": {
        "conflicts": "design-materializations/demos__react-demo-app__src__App.figma-conflicts.json"
      },
      "summary": {
        "conflicts": 3,
        "decisions": 2
      }
    },
    {
      "runId": "def67890",
      "sourceFile": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
      "timestamp": "2025-12-30T11:00:00.000Z",
      "cwd": "/repo/packages/watcher",
      "repoRoot": "/repo",
      "command": "figma:apply",
      "mode": "artifact",
      "artifacts": {},
      "summary": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

### Run ID Generation

Run IDs are deterministic 8-character hex strings generated via djb2 hash:

```
runId = djb2(sourceFile + timestamp + command + sortedArtifactPaths)
```

This ensures:
- Same inputs → same ID (deterministic)
- Different inputs → different ID (unique per run)
- Collision-resistant for practical purposes

### CLI Usage

```bash
# View timeline for a file (read-only mode)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:timeline demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# JSON output
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:timeline demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --json

# Limit results
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:timeline demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --limit 5

# Verbose mode (show artifact paths)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:timeline demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --verbose

# Explicitly record a run to the ledger (requires feature flag)
RECONCILIATION_TIMELINE_ON=true pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:timeline demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --record

# Force write ledger artifact (for testing only)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:timeline demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --write
```

### Recording Runs (Phase 13B.1)

**Recording is explicit and opt-in.** No command automatically records runs to the ledger.

To record a run, BOTH conditions must be met:
1. The `--record` flag is present
2. The `RECONCILIATION_TIMELINE_ON=true` environment variable is set

```bash
# This will record a run:
RECONCILIATION_TIMELINE_ON=true pnpm figma:timeline demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --record

# This will NOT record (no feature flag):
pnpm figma:timeline demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --record
# Output: ⚠️  Recording disabled: RECONCILIATION_TIMELINE_ON is not set to "true"

# This will NOT record (no --record flag):
RECONCILIATION_TIMELINE_ON=true pnpm figma:timeline demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
# Output: ℹ️ Read-only mode (use --record to append a run)
```

### Example Output

```
=== FIGMA RUN TIMELINE (Phase 13B) ===
Repo Root: /path/to/repo
Source: demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx (canonical)

Runs (newest first, showing 3 of 3):

[def67890] 2025-12-30 11:00:00
  Command: figma:apply
  Mode: artifact
  Summary: (none)

[abc12345] 2025-12-30 10:00:00
  Command: figma:status
  Summary: 3 conflicts, 2 decisions

[xyz99999] 2025-12-29 15:30:00
  Command: figma:verify
  Summary: 5 verified, 1 mismatch, 0 missing
```

### Relation to Phase 13A

| Phase | Purpose | Type |
|-------|---------|------|
| 13A: Index | Current artifact snapshot | One-shot |
| 13B: Timeline | Historical run ledger | Append-only |

Phase 13B uses Phase 13A's artifact discovery to populate each run entry's artifacts and summary fields.

### Guarantees

- **Append-only**: Runs are only ever added, never modified or deleted
- **Deterministic IDs**: Same run → same runId
- **Repo-root invariant**: Works identically from any working directory
- **Explicit recording**: Recording ONLY when `--record` flag + `RECONCILIATION_TIMELINE_ON=true`
- **No implicit side effects**: Other commands never record runs; user must explicitly opt-in
- **Read-only default**: Timeline CLI reads ledger unless `--record` is specified

---

## Drift Diffs (Phase 13C)

Phase 13C adds run-to-run comparison capability, turning the timeline ledger from Phase 13B into actionable drift detection. It compares two runs and summarizes what changed between them.

### Key Question

**"What changed between this run and the previous run?"**

This enables:
- **Regression detection**: Catching status worsening (VERIFIED_OK → VERIFY_FAILED)
- **Trend analysis**: Tracking verification mismatches over time
- **Debugging**: Understanding what triggered a failure

### Drift Diff Artifact

Pattern: `design-materializations/<file>.figma-drift-diff.json`

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "sourceFile": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
  "fromRunId": "abc12345",
  "toRunId": "def67890",
  "generatedAt": "2025-12-30T12:00:00.000Z",
  "summary": {
    "totalChanges": 2,
    "infoCount": 1,
    "warnCount": 0,
    "failCount": 1,
    "insufficientHistory": false,
    "message": "1 regression(s), 0 warning(s), 1 info change(s)"
  },
  "changes": [
    {
      "field": "overallStatus",
      "from": "VERIFIED_OK",
      "to": "VERIFY_FAILED",
      "severity": "fail",
      "reason": "Status worsened from VERIFIED_OK to VERIFY_FAILED"
    },
    {
      "field": "verifyMismatch",
      "from": 0,
      "to": 2,
      "delta": 2,
      "severity": "fail",
      "reason": "Verification mismatches increased by 2"
    }
  ],
  "from": { "runId": "abc12345", "timestamp": "...", "command": "...", ... },
  "to": { "runId": "def67890", "timestamp": "...", "command": "...", ... }
}
```

### Severity Rules

| Change | Severity | Condition |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Status worsening | fail | To VERIFY_FAILED or worse |
| Status worsening | warn | To APPLIED_UNVERIFIED |
| verifyMismatch increase | fail | Any increase > 0 |
| verifyMissing increase | fail | Any increase > 0 |
| conflictsTotal increase | warn | Any increase > 0 |
| deltasTotal increase | warn | Any increase > 0 |
| applyDryRun toggle | info | Any change |
| Status improving | info | Level decreasing |
| CLEAN ↔ VERIFIED_OK | info | Both good states |

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Compare latest vs previous run
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:drift demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# JSON output
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:drift demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --json

# Compare specific runs
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:drift demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --from abc12345 --to def67890

# Write artifact to disk
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:drift demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --write

# Verbose mode (show artifact paths and reasons)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:drift demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --verbose

# Explain run selection (Phase 13C.1)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:drift demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --explain

# Strict mode for CI: exit 1 if any 'fail' severity (Phase 13C.1)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:drift demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --strict
```

### Preconditions Banner (Phase 13C.1)

Every drift command now prints a preconditions header before results:

```
=== DRIFT DIFF PRECONDITIONS ===
Repo Root: /path/to/repo
Source (input): ../../demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
Source (canonical): demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
Ledger: ✓ found
Run selection:
  from: abc12345 (2025-12-30T10:00:00.000Z)
  to:   def67890 (2025-12-30T11:00:00.000Z)
```

### Run Selection Explanation (--explain)

The `--explain` flag provides detailed reasoning about run selection:

```bash
pnpm figma:drift demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --explain
```

Output:
```
=== RUN SELECTION EXPLANATION ===
From Run:
  Method: previous
  Reason: Auto-selected as second-to-last run (default comparison baseline)
  Explicit: no (auto-selected)

To Run:
  Method: latest
  Reason: Auto-selected as latest run (most recent in ledger)
  Explicit: no (auto-selected)
```

### Candidate Validation (Phase 13C.2)

Before computing drift, candidates are validated to ensure meaningful comparison:

#### Run States

Each run is classified based on its artifacts:

| State | Description | Has Verification | Has Apply |
|-------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| `VERIFIED_OK` | Run completed with verification | ✓ | - |
| `VERIFIED_MISMATCH` | Verified but found mismatches | ✓ | - |
| `APPLY_ONLY` | Applied changes but never verified | ✗ | ✓ |
| `INCOMPLETE` | Has some artifacts but not verification or apply | ✗ | ✗ |
| `EMPTY` | No reconciliation artifacts | ✗ | ✗ |

#### Comparison Classes

The comparison class indicates the confidence level of the drift analysis:

| Class | Description | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `FULL` | Both runs verified | ✓ High confidence |
| `PARTIAL` | One run verified | ⚠️ Warning printed |
| `WEAK` | Neither run verified | ⚠️ Warning printed, `--strict` fails |
| `INVALID` | Missing artifacts | ❌ Not meaningful, `--strict` fails |

#### Example Output

```
=== CANDIDATE CLASSIFICATION (Phase 13C.2) ===
From Run: abc12345
  State: VERIFIED_OK
  Artifacts: status, verification
To Run: def67890
  State: APPLY_ONLY
  Artifacts: resolutionApply
Comparison Class: PARTIAL

⚠️ Drift comparison is PARTIAL
Reason: to run has not been verified
Results may reflect incomplete reconciliation
```

#### Strict Mode Enforcement

With `--strict`, the command exits with code 1 when:
- Comparison class is `INVALID` or `WEAK`
- Any drift item has severity `fail`

### No Material Drift Message (Phase 13C.1)

When no significant changes exist (empty changes or all 'info' with zero deltas):

```
✓ No material drift detected between runs.
```

### Example Output

```
=== DRIFT DIFF PRECONDITIONS ===
Repo Root: /path/to/repo
Source (input): demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
Source (canonical): demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx
Ledger: ✓ found
Run selection:
  from: abc12345 (2025-12-30T10:00:00.000Z)
  to:   def67890 (2025-12-30T11:00:00.000Z)

=== FIGMA DRIFT DIFF (Phase 13C) ===
Repo Root: /path/to/repo
Source: demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx (canonical)

Comparing: [abc12345] → [def67890]

From:
  Run ID: abc12345
  Timestamp: 2025-12-30T10:00:00.000Z
  Command: figma:status
  Status: VERIFIED_OK

To:
  Run ID: def67890
  Timestamp: 2025-12-30T11:00:00.000Z
  Command: figma:status
  Status: VERIFY_FAILED

Summary: 1 regression(s), 0 warning(s), 1 info change(s)

Changes (2):
  [FAIL] overallStatus: VERIFIED_OK → VERIFY_FAILED
  [FAIL] verifyMismatch: 0 → 2 (+2)
```

### Run Selection

By default, compares the latest run vs the previous run:
- **Default**: `runs[n-2]` (from) vs `runs[n-1]` (to)
- **Explicit**: Use `--from` and/or `--to` with run IDs

If fewer than 2 runs exist, produces an artifact with `insufficientHistory: true`.

### Relation to Other Phases

| Phase | Purpose | Type |
|-------|---------|------|
| 13A: Index | Current artifact snapshot | One-shot |
| 13B: Timeline | Historical run ledger | Append-only |
| 13C: Drift | Run-to-run comparison | Read-only diff |

### Guarantees

- **Deterministic**: Same runs → same diff output
- **Deterministic ordering**: Changes sorted by severity (fail > warn > info), then field name
- **Read-only**: Never modifies any artifacts or source files
- **Repo-root invariant**: Works identically from any working directory
- **Preconditions visible**: Always shows source paths, ledger status, run selection
- **Exit code 0**: Default success (even with insufficient history)
- **Exit code 1**: With `--strict`, if any drift item has 'fail' severity
- **Exit code 2**: Usage error (invalid arguments)

---

## Drift Summary Dashboard (Phase 13D)

Phase 13D adds an aggregated dashboard that summarizes drift across multiple reconciliation runs. It provides an "at a glance" view of design drift over time for a source file, with a stability score, severity counts, top drift signals, and a CI-friendly verdict.

### Artifact

```
design-materializations/<file>.figma-drift-dashboard.json
```

Example path: `design-materializations/demos__react-demo-app__src__App.figma-drift-dashboard.json`

### Structure

```json

    }
  ],
  "ciVerdict": "WARN",
  "exitCode": 0,
  "explanation": "1 warn-severity drift detected"
}
```

### Stability Score

The stability score starts at 100 and deducts points based on drift severity:

| Severity | Deduction |
|----------|-----------|
| fail | -25 per event |
| warn | -10 per event |
| info | -2 per event |

The score is clamped to the range 0-100.

### CI Verdict

| Verdict | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| PASS | No significant drift detected |
| WARN | Warn-severity drifts but no failures |
| FAIL | Fail-severity drift or threshold exceeded |

### Thresholds

Configurable via environment variables or CLI flags:

| Threshold | Default | Environment Variable |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| Fail on fail severity | true | `DASHBOARD_FAIL_ON_FAIL_SEVERITY` |
| Max fail count | 1 | `DASHBOARD_MAX_FAIL` |
| Max warn count | none | `DASHBOARD_MAX_WARN` |
| Max verify mismatch increase | none | `DASHBOARD_MAX_VERIFY_MISMATCH_INCREASE` |
| Max conflict increase | none | `DASHBOARD_MAX_CONFLICT_INCREASE` |

### Exit Code

- **exit 0**: Default behavior (even for WARN or FAIL verdicts)
- **exit 1**: Only when `--strict` flag or `DASHBOARD_CI_STRICT=true` AND verdict is FAIL

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx

# JSON output
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --json

# Custom run window
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --limit 20

# Specific run range
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --from abc12345 --to def67890

# Write artifact to disk
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --write

## Project Drift Dashboard (Phase 13E)

Phase 13E adds directory-level aggregation of Phase 13D dashboards. It scans a directory for source files, computes or loads dashboards for each file, and produces a project-level summary with an overall verdict, stability score, and top drift signals across all files.

### Artifact

```
design-materializations/<scanRoot>.figma-project-dashboard.json
```

Example path: `design-materializations/demos__react-demo-app__src.figma-project-dashboard.json`

### Structure

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "generatedAt": "2025-12-30T12:00:00.000Z",

    }
  ],

      "severityCounts": { "fail": 0, "warn": 1, "info": 3 }
    }
  ],
  "projectVerdict": "FAIL",
  "exitCode": 0,
  "explanation": "1 file with FAIL verdict"
}
```

### File Discovery

The scanner searches for `**/*.tsx` files in the scan root, excluding:

- `node_modules/`
- `dist/`
- `build/`
- `.next/`
- `.turbo/`
- `.git/`
- `coverage/`

Files are processed in lexicographically sorted order for determinism.

### Per-File Dashboard Loading

For each discovered file, the project dashboard:

1. Attempts to load an existing Phase 13D dashboard artifact
2. If no artifact exists, attempts to compute a dashboard in-memory (requires run ledger)
3. If no data is available, records the file as `NO_DATA`
4. On any error, records the file as `ERROR` with the error message

### Project Verdict

The project verdict is the worst verdict across all files:

| Condition | Project Verdict |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Any file has FAIL verdict | FAIL |
| No FAIL but any file has WARN verdict | WARN |
| All files are PASS or NO_DATA | PASS |

### Project Stability Score

The project stability score is the average of file stability scores, excluding files with NO_DATA or ERROR status:

```
projectScore = sum(file.stabilityScore) / filesWithData
```

### Top Signals

Project-level signals are merged from all file dashboards and sorted deterministically:

1. Severity (fail → warn → info)
2. Magnitude (descending absolute delta)
3. File path (ascending lexicographic)
4. Signal key (ascending lexicographic)

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Basic usage (scan demos/react-demo-app/src)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:project-dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src

# JSON output
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:project-dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src --json

# Limit top signals
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:project-dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src --limit 10

# Write artifact to disk
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:project-dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src --write

# CI strict mode (exit 1 on FAIL)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:project-dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src --strict

# Custom repo root
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:project-dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src --repo-root /path/to/repo

# Verbose mode (show all files)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:project-dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src --verbose

# Custom thresholds
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:project-dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src --fail-score 50 --warn-score 70

# Limit max signals in output
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:project-dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src --max-signals 5
```

### Threshold Configuration (Phase 13E.1)

The project dashboard uses configurable score thresholds to determine the verdict. Thresholds can be set via CLI flags or environment variables, with CLI taking precedence.

#### Threshold Precedence

1. **CLI flags** (highest priority)
2. **Environment variables**
3. **Built-in defaults** (lowest priority)

#### Configuration Options

| CLI Flag | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--fail-score` | `RECONCILIATION_DASHBOARD_FAIL_SCORE` | 60 | Scores below this are FAIL |
| `--warn-score` | `RECONCILIATION_DASHBOARD_WARN_SCORE` | 80 | Scores below this (but ≥ fail) are WARN |
| `--max-signals` | `RECONCILIATION_DASHBOARD_MAX_SIGNALS` | 10 | Maximum signals shown in output |

#### Verdict Rules

| Condition | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| `score < failScore` | **FAIL** |
| `failScore ≤ score < warnScore` | **WARN** |
| `score ≥ warnScore` | **PASS** |

#### Invariant

The invariant `failScore < warnScore` is enforced at resolution time. Invalid configurations exit with code 2:

```bash
# Error: fail-score must be less than warn-score
pnpm figma:project-dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src --fail-score 80 --warn-score 70
# Exit code: 2
```

#### Environment Variable Examples

```bash
# Set thresholds via environment
export RECONCILIATION_DASHBOARD_FAIL_SCORE=50
export RECONCILIATION_DASHBOARD_WARN_SCORE=75
export RECONCILIATION_DASHBOARD_MAX_SIGNALS=20

pnpm figma:project-dashboard demos/react-demo-app/src
```

| **1** | `--strict` flag or `PROJECT_DASHBOARD_CI_STRICT=true` AND verdict is FAIL |
| **2** | Invalid configuration (e.g., `--fail-score >= --warn-score`) |

### Relation to Other Phases

| Phase | Scope | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 13D: Dashboard | Per-file | Aggregated drift summary for one file |
| 13E: Project Dashboard | Directory | Aggregated summary across many files |

### Guarantees

- **Deterministic**: Same files → same output (sorted, stable)
- **Read-only**: Never modifies any source files or artifacts
- **Repo-root invariant**: Works identically from any working directory
- **CI-friendly**: Configurable exit codes for build gates

## CI Gate Summary (Phase 13F)

Phase 13F adds a CI-focused command that computes a pass/warn/fail decision from Phase 13E project dashboard data, with a small trend window derived from Phase 13B ledgers.

### Artifact

```
design-materializations/<scanRoot>.figma-ci-gate.json
```

Example path: `design-materializations/demos__react-demo-app__src.figma-ci-gate.json`

### Structure

```json
{
  "version": 1,

    "filesNoData": 2,
    "filesWithErrors": 0,
    "byVerdict": { "pass": 5, "warn": 2, "fail": 1 },
    "bySeverity": { "fail": 3, "warn": 5, "info": 12 }
  },
  "stabilityScore": {
    "value": 72,
    "filesIncluded": 8,
    "filesExcluded": 2
  },
  "trend": {
    "improving": 3,
    "stable": 4,
    "worsening": 1,
    "insufficientData": 2,
    "windowSize": 5,
    "files": [
      {
        "sourceFile": "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
        "runsInWindow": 5,
        "direction": "improving",
        "startScore": 80,
        "endScore": 90,
        "scoreDelta": 10
      }
    ]
  },
  "topSignals": [...],
  "files": [...],
  "verdict": "FAIL",
  "exitCode": 0,
  "explanation": "1 file with FAIL verdict"
}
```

### Trend Window

The trend summary looks at the last N runs (default: 5) for each file to determine direction:

| Direction | Condition |
|-----------|-----------|
| improving | Score increased by ≥5 points |
| stable | Score changed by <5 points |
| worsening | Score decreased by ≥5 points |

Files with fewer than 2 runs in the window are marked as "insufficient data".

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:ci demos/react-demo-app/src

# JSON output
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:ci demos/react-demo-app/src --json

# Custom trend window
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:ci demos/react-demo-app/src --window 10

# Write artifact to disk
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:ci demos/react-demo-app/src --write

# CI strict mode (exit 1 on FAIL)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:ci demos/react-demo-app/src --strict

# Verbose mode (show all files and trends)
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:ci demos/react-demo-app/src --verbose
```

### Example Output

  ↓ Worsening: 1
  ? Insufficient data: 2

CI Verdict:
  ✗ FAIL
  1 file with FAIL verdict
  Exit code: 0
```

### Exit Code

- **exit 0**: Default behavior (even for WARN or FAIL verdicts)
- **exit 1**: Only when `--strict` flag or `RECONCILIATION_CI_STRICT=true` AND verdict is FAIL

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RECONCILIATION_CI_STRICT` | `false` | Exit 1 on FAIL verdict |
| `RECONCILIATION_CI_WINDOW` | `5` | Trend window size (runs per file) |
| `DASHBOARD_LIMIT` | `10` | Max runs to consider per file for dashboard |

### Relation to Other Phases

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 13B: Timeline | Provides run ledger for trend computation |
| 13D: Dashboard | Per-file drift aggregation |
| 13E: Project Dashboard | Multi-file aggregation (reused by 13F) |
| 13F: CI Gate | CI-focused gate with trend window |

### Guarantees

- **Deterministic**: Same inputs → same output
- **Read-only**: Never modifies any source files or artifacts
- **Repo-root invariant**: Works identically from any working directory
- **CI-friendly**: Only `--strict` can cause non-zero exit

### Color Mapping

Vuetify semantic colors are mapped to hex values:

| Vuetify Color | Hex Value |
|---------------|-----------|
| `primary` | #1976D2 |
| `success` | #4CAF50 |
| `error` | #FF5252 |
| `warning` | #FB8C00 |
| `info` | #2196F3 |

### Confidence Levels

| Prop Type | Confidence | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| String literal | `high` | `color="primary"` |
| Static template | `high` | `` color={`primary`} `` |
| Boolean shorthand | `high` | `disabled` |
| Variable/expression | `low` | `color={buttonColor}` |

### SemanticAdapter Interface

Custom adapters implement this interface:

```typescript
interface SemanticAdapter {
  readonly id: string;           // e.g., 'vuetify'
  readonly displayName: string;  // e.g., 'Vuetify'
  readonly priority?: number;    // Lower = runs earlier

  supports(node: JSXElement, ctx: AdapterContext): boolean;
  extract(node: JSXElement, ctx: AdapterContext): AdapterResult;
}
```

### Merge Rules

When adapter semantics are merged with generic JSX semantics:

1. **Adapter wins** for fields it explicitly sets
2. **Generic JSX preserved** for fields adapter doesn't set
3. **No erasure** - adapters cannot remove existing values
4. **Provenance tracked** - each value knows its source

### CLI Output

The `pnpm ast:report` command now includes adapter semantics:

```
=== ADAPTER SEMANTICS (Phase 10A) ===
Components with adapter matches: 3

  LoginButton
    Adapter: Vuetify
    Fields: visual.fills, booleans.disabled
    Confidence: high
    Metadata: { component: 'v-btn', vuetifyColor: 'primary' }
```

---

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### "Figma doesn't update when I save a file"

1. **Check server is running**: `pnpm dev:server` should show "HTTP server listening on http://localhost:3001"
2. **Check watcher is running**: `pnpm dev:watcher` should show "Watcher started"
3. **Check plugin is connected**: Plugin UI should show "Connected" status
4. **Check for markers**: File must contain `// @figma node=...` markers
5. **Check node names match**: Figma nodes must be named exactly as specified in markers

### "Operations sent but node not found in Figma"

Look for this log in the server:
```
[Server] ✗ OPERATION_RESULT failed for requestId=...
[Server]   Error: Node not found: "LoginButton"
```

Solutions:
- Verify node exists with exact name in Figma
- Use `component-map.json` for stable ID mapping
- Enable `DEBUG_LIST_VARIANTS=true` in plugin to see available nodes

### "Duplicate operations sent"

The suppression system should prevent this. If it happens:

1. Check suppression logs: `TRACE=true pnpm dev:watcher`
2. Look for: `[Trace] [suppression]` entries
3. If different ops are being incorrectly suppressed, the ops-hash may need debugging

### "Override changes not reflected"

1. Check `design-overrides.json` exists with the node entry
2. Verify `USE_OVERRIDES=true` (default)
3. Check precedence: `OVERRIDES_PRECEDENCE=always` means overrides always win
4. If using `if_newer_than_code`, ensure override timestamp is newer than file mtime

### "LLM mode returns empty intents"

1. Verify API key is set: `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
2. Check provider setting: `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` or `anthropic`
3. Look for fallback: `[Watcher] LLM failed, falling back to markers`
4. Try with markers first to verify basic pipeline works

### Enable Verbose Diagnostics

```bash
# Full trace output with timing details
TRACE=true TRACE_VERBOSE=true ENABLE_AUDIT_LOG=true pnpm dev:watcher
```

---

## Demo Scripts (Phase 9C)

Quick-start scripts for demos and development:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm demo:server` | Start the relay server with pretty logging |
| `pnpm demo:watcher` | Start the file watcher with trace output |
| `pnpm demo:feature` | Run the feature orchestrator CLI |
| `pnpm demo:fast` | Start server + watcher concurrently |
| `pnpm demo:tunnel` | Expose server via cloudflared for Figma access |

### Professional Demo Runbook

**Setup (5 minutes before demo):**

1. Start server and watcher:
   ```bash
   pnpm demo:fast
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the tunnel:
   ```bash
   pnpm demo:tunnel
   ```
   Copy the HTTPS URL.

3. Open Figma, run the plugin, paste the tunnel URL, click Connect.

4. Verify connection by saving a file with `@figma` markers and watching Figma update.

**During Demo:**

1. **Show Code → Design**: Edit a file, save, watch Figma update in real-time.

2. **Show Design → Code**: In Figma, select a node, click "Send Selection" in the plugin.
   Show `design-overrides.json` updating.

3. **Show Feature Orchestrator**:
   ```bash
   pnpm demo:feature --file demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx \
     --prompt "Change the Card background to success green"
   ```
   Show the patch artifact generated.

4. **Show Immediate Apply** (Phase 9B):
   ```bash
   POST_APPLY_EMIT=true AST_WRITE_MODE=write AST_WRITE_DRY_RUN=false \
     pnpm demo:feature --file demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx \
     --prompt "Change the button text to Submit" --apply
   ```
   Watch Figma update immediately without waiting for file-save detection.

---

## Reconciliation System (Phase 14)

The reconciliation system provides a unified CLI for analyzing design ↔ code drift. **All Phase 12–13 analysis is now reachable through `figma:reconcile`.**

### Entry Point

The primary orchestration command is:

```bash
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:reconcile <source-file> [options]
```

This single command runs the complete Phase 12–13 read-only analysis sequence:

| Step | Phase | Command Equivalent | Description |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1. status | 12J | `figma:status` | Compute reconciliation status |
| 2. index | 13A | `figma:index` | Index existing artifacts |
| 3. timeline | 13B | `figma:timeline` | Load/record timeline ledger |
| 4. drift | 13C | `figma:drift` | Compute run-to-run drift diffs |
| 5. dashboard | 13D | `figma:dashboard` | Generate drift summary dashboard |

Each step is deterministic and read-only by default. The command produces a single **bundle artifact** that links all outputs.

### Profiles (Authoritative Table)

Profiles are deterministic flag presets. CLI flags always override profile defaults.

| Profile | `strict` | `record` | `write` | `alwaysWriteBundle` | Intended Use |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| `local` | `false` | `false` | `false` | `false` | Human inspection |
| `record` | `false` | `true` | `true` | `true` | Run capture |
| `ci` | `true` | `false` | `false` | `true` | CI gate |

**Key behaviors:**

- **local** (default): Safe for iterative development. No side effects.
- **record**: Captures timeline runs. Requires `RECONCILIATION_TIMELINE_ON=true`.
- **ci**: Strict mode. Always writes bundle artifact for attribution, even though `write=false`.

**Precedence:** CLI flags > Profile defaults

```bash
# Use ci profile but disable strict mode
figma:reconcile demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --profile ci --no-strict
```

### Output Formats

| Format | Flag | When to Use |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `human` | `--format human` (default) | Local development, human inspection |
| `json` | `--format json` or `--json` | Programmatic processing, debugging |
| `ci` | `--format ci` | GitHub Actions, CI pipelines |

**CI format guarantees stable key=value output for parsing:**

```
✓ VERDICT: PASS

--- CI SUMMARY ---

profile=ci
verdict=PASS
ok=true
timestamp=2026-01-05T15:28:19.046Z

```

### Exit Code Contract

| Exit Code | Meaning | CI Behavior |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `0` | PASS or WARN | CI passes |
| `1` | FAIL (strict violation) | CI fails |
| `2` | Usage or configuration error | CI fails |

**Important:** `WARN` never fails CI. Exit code 0 includes both PASS and WARN verdicts.

### Verdict Semantics

| Verdict | Condition | Exit Code |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **PASS** | All steps OK, no warnings | 0 |
| **WARN** | Steps OK but: PARTIAL drift comparison, missing artifacts, dashboard warn > 0 | 0 |
| **FAIL** | Strict mode AND: dashboard fail > 0, INVALID drift, step failure | 1 |

### Artifact Model

All artifacts are written to `design-materializations/` with deterministic naming:

```
design-materializations/<source-path>.figma-<artifact-type>.json
```

Where `<source-path>` has `/` replaced with `__` and the file extension removed.

Example: `demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx` → `demos__react-demo-app__src__App`

**Artifact Types by Phase:**

| Artifact | Phase | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `.figma-delta.json` | 12A | Figma → Code deltas detected |
| `.figma-delta-suggestions.json` | 12B | Suggested delta applications |
| `.figma-conflicts.json` | 12D | Conflict analysis |
| `.figma-resolution-plan.json` | 12E | Guided resolution decisions |
| `.figma-resolution-apply.json` | 12F | Resolution application results |
| `.figma-verification.json` | 12G | Post-apply verification |
| `.figma-rollback-preview.json` | 12I | Rollback preview |
| `.figma-reconciliation-status.json` | 12J | Overall status |
| `.figma-run-index.json` | 13A | Run artifact index |
| `.figma-run-ledger.json` | 13B | Append-only timeline ledger |
| `.figma-drift-diff.json` | 13C | Run-to-run drift diff |
| `.figma-drift-dashboard.json` | 13D | Drift summary dashboard |

**Bundle Artifact (`figma-reconcile.json`):**

- **Always written** in CI profile (`alwaysWriteBundle=true`)
- Contains: version, timestamp, repoRoot, sourceFile, profile, mode, steps, artifacts, overall verdict
- Includes git SHA for attribution
- Provides deterministic naming for CI artifact upload

```

---

## Quick Start (Demo)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- pnpm ≥ 9

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start the Server

```bash
pnpm dev:server
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:3001` with:
- WebSocket: `ws://localhost:3001/ws`
- HTTP polling: `GET /poll`
- Test endpoint: `POST /test`

### Start the Watcher

```bash
pnpm dev:watcher
```

Watches `demos/react-demo-app/src/` for changes by default.

### Add @figma Markers

In any `.tsx` or `.ts` file:

```tsx
// @figma node=<FigmaNodeName> text="<Text>" fill=<TokenOrHex>
```

Examples:
```tsx
// @figma node=LoginButton text="Sign In" fill=Primary/Blue500
// @figma node=ErrorMessage text="Something went wrong" fill=#EF4444
// @figma node=CardBackground fill=Neutral/Gray50
```

---

## Human Test Walkthrough

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
pnpm dev:server
```

### 2. Start the Watcher

```bash
pnpm dev:watcher
```

### 3. Expose Server via Tunnel (for Figma access)

```bash
pnpm tunnel
```

Copy the tunnel URL (e.g., `https://xxx.trycloudflare.com`).

### 4. Connect Figma Plugin

1. In Figma, run the Aesthetic Function plugin
2. Enter the tunnel URL
3. Click "Connect"
4. Status should show "Connected"

### 5. Code → Figma Sync

1. Edit a file in `demos/react-demo-app/src/` with `@figma` markers
2. Save the file
3. Watch the Figma document update in real-time

### 6. Figma → Code Capture

1. In Figma, select a node (text or frame)
2. In the plugin, click "Send Selection"
3. The server logs `DESIGN_CHANGE` and writes to `design-overrides.json`

### 7. Reconciliation Behavior

On the next file save:
- The watcher loads overrides from `design-overrides.json`
- Override values are merged with code-derived intents
- The merged result is sent to Figma
- Watcher logs show: `Overrides: precedence=always applied=N ignored=M`

### 8. Resetting Overrides

To clear all overrides and let code take precedence:

```bash
rm design-overrides.json
```

Or disable overrides temporarily:

```bash
USE_OVERRIDES=false pnpm dev:watcher
```

---

## CI Integration (Phase 14D)

This section covers GitHub Actions integration. For the complete `figma:reconcile` reference, see [Reconciliation System (Phase 14)](#reconciliation-system-phase-14).

### Required Command

```bash
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:reconcile <source-file> --profile ci --format ci --verbose
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow is defined in [.github/workflows/figma-reconcile-ci.yml](.github/workflows/figma-reconcile-ci.yml).

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests targeting `main`

**Job Outputs (available via `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`):**
- `verdict` — PASS, WARN, or FAIL
- `bundle_path` — Path to the reconcile bundle artifact
- `stability_score` — Stability score (0-100)
- `git_sha` — Git commit SHA for traceability

**Uploaded Artifacts:**
- `figma-reconcile-<run_id>-<sha>` — Always uploaded (bundle artifact)
- `figma-reconcile-all-<run_id>-<sha>` — Optionally uploaded (all materializations)

### Running CI Locally

```bash
# From repo root
pnpm --filter @aesthetic-function/watcher figma:reconcile demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --profile ci --format ci --verbose

# Or from watcher directory
cd packages/watcher
pnpm figma:reconcile demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx --profile ci --format ci --verbose
```

### Interpreting CI Results

| Verdict | Exit Code | CI Behavior | Action |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **PASS** | 0 | Passes | Merge with confidence |
| **WARN** | 0 | Passes | Review warnings, but CI passes |
| **FAIL** | 1 | Fails | CI blocks merge; investigate dashboard fail count or INVALID drift |

**WARN conditions (CI still passes):**
- PARTIAL drift comparison (missing apply/verify artifacts)
- Dashboard warn count > 0
- Cold-start conditions (see below)

**FAIL conditions (CI blocks merge):**
- Dashboard fail count > 0
- INVALID drift classification
- Any step failure in strict mode (excluding cold-start skips)

### Cold-Start Handling (Phase 14D.1)

On **fresh checkouts** or **first CI runs**, the run ledger (`design-materializations/<file>.figma-run-ledger.json`) may not exist. This is a normal condition when:
- Running CI for the first time on a new component
- Cloning a repo where materializations were gitignored
- Adding a new source file to the reconciliation matrix

**Cold-start behavior:**
- **Drift and Dashboard steps are skipped** (not failed)
- **Overall verdict is WARN** (exit code 0, CI passes)
- **Reason**: "Cold-start: skipped drift, dashboard (no ledger data yet)"

**Example CI output (cold-start):**
```
⚠ VERDICT: WARN
--- CI SUMMARY ---
source=demos/react-demo-app/src/Card.tsx
profile=ci
verdict=WARN
ok=true
--- STEPS ---
status=ok
index=ok
timeline=ok
drift=ok
dashboard=ok
reason=Cold-start: skipped drift, dashboard (no ledger data yet)
Exit code: 0
```

**Resolution**: Run `figma:reconcile` with `--record` to populate the ledger. After 2+ recorded runs, drift and dashboard steps will execute normally.

---

## Multi-Source CI (Phase 14F)

Phase 14F extends single-file reconciliation to multiple sources using GitHub Actions matrix strategy. This enables running `figma:reconcile` across all component files in parallel with aggregated verdict.

### Source Discovery

Sources can be specified via:
1. **Manifest file** (`reconcile.sources.json`) — Explicit list of files
2. **Glob patterns** — Match files by pattern (e.g., `**/*.tsx`)
3. **CLI arguments** — Direct `--source` flags

Discovery order: explicit > glob > manifest > default glob (`**/*.tsx`)

#### Manifest Format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "sources": [
    "demos/react-demo-app/src/App.tsx",
    "demos/react-demo-app/src/Card.tsx"
  ],
  "ignore": [
    "**/internal/**"
  ]
}
```

#### CLI Commands

```bash
# Discover all sources (outputs JSON)
pnpm figma:sources

# With custom glob
pnpm figma:sources --glob "src/**/*.tsx"

# Get chunk 0 for matrix job
pnpm figma:sources --chunk-size 5 --chunk-index 0

# Output matrix indices for GitHub Actions
pnpm figma:sources --matrix-indices --chunk-size 10

# Just count
pnpm figma:sources --output count
```

### Chunking

Sources are chunked for parallel matrix execution:
- Default chunk size: 10
- Deterministic ordering (lexicographic sort)
- Balanced distribution (avoids tiny final chunks)

Example: 27 sources with chunk size 10 → 3 chunks of [9, 9, 9]

### Matrix Workflow

The matrix workflow is defined in [.github/workflows/figma-reconcile-ci-matrix.yml](.github/workflows/figma-reconcile-ci-matrix.yml).

**Jobs:**
1. **discover** — Find sources, calculate chunks, output matrix indices
2. **reconcile** — Matrix job running reconcile for each chunk
3. **aggregate** — Combine verdicts, produce overall PASS/WARN/FAIL

**Triggers:**
- Pull requests touching `.tsx` files
- Manual `workflow_dispatch` with glob/chunk-size inputs

### Aggregation

Verdicts are aggregated with precedence:
- **FAIL** > **WARN** > **PASS**
- Any FAIL → overall FAIL
- Any WARN (no FAIL) → overall WARN
- All PASS → overall PASS

### CLI Reference

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--repo-root <path>` | Repository root | `cwd` |
| `--glob <pattern>` | Glob pattern for sources | `**/*.tsx` |
| `--manifest <path>` | Manifest file path | `reconcile.sources.json` |
| `--source <path>` | Explicit source (repeatable) | — |
| `--ignore <pattern>` | Ignore pattern (repeatable) | node_modules, dist, etc. |
| `--chunk-size <n>` | Sources per chunk | 10 |
| `--chunk-index <n>` | Get specific chunk | — |
| `--matrix-indices` | Output chunk indices only | false |
| `--output <format>` | Output format: json, list, count | json |

## Design Tokens

The watcher resolves semantic tokens to hex values:

| Token | Hex |
|-------|-----|
| `Primary/Blue500` | `#3B82F6` |
| `Success/Green500` | `#10B981` |
| `Error/Red500` | `#EF4444` |
| `Warning/Yellow500` | `#F59E0B` |
| `Neutral/Gray50` | `#F9FAFB` |
| `Neutral/Gray900` | `#111827` |

Raw hex values (e.g., `#FF0000`) pass through unchanged.

---

## Audit Trail

The server can log all broadcast operations to `sync-log.md` for debugging and traceability.

### Enable Audit Logging

```bash
ENABLE_AUDIT_LOG=true pnpm dev:server
```

### Log Format

```markdown
## [2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z] [req-abc123] type=APPLY_OPERATIONS source=watcher
file=demos/react-demo-app/src/Card.tsx
ops=2
- node="LoginButton" action=SET_FILL value="#3B82F6"
- node="LoginButton" action=SET_TEXT value="Sign In"
```

### Behavior

- **Default**: Audit logging is disabled
- **Async**: Logging is non-blocking with an in-memory queue (100ms flush interval)
- **Graceful shutdown**: Queue is flushed on SIGINT/SIGTERM

---

## Git Hygiene

The following files are **intentionally gitignored** as runtime artifacts:

| File/Directory | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `design-overrides.json` | Captured design changes (local state) |
| `component-map.json` | Stable Figma node ID mappings (Phase 8C) |
| `sync-log.md` | Audit trail (debug artifact) |
| `design-materializations/` | Generated patch artifacts (Phase 5B) |

These files are machine-local and should not be committed by default. Each developer/environment maintains their own override state. However, `component-map.json` can optionally be committed for team sharing of stable ID mappings.

```

**Transport modes (in order of preference):**
1. **stdio** — AF spawns figma-console-mcp as a child process via `npx figma-console-mcp`
   and communicates over stdin/stdout using the MCP stdio transport.
2. **sse** — AF connects to an already-running figma-console-mcp SSE server.
3. **rest-fallback** — Direct Figma REST API calls when figma-console-mcp is unavailable.

**Tool mapping (figma-console-mcp tool → AF adapter method):**

| MCP Tool | AF Method | Data |
|----------|-----------|------|
| `figma_get_variables` | `getDesignTokens()` | Design variables/tokens |
| `figma_get_file_data` | `getComponent()`, `getComponents()`, `getFileData()` | File tree, nodes, components |
| `figma_get_styles` | `getStyles()` | Published styles |
| `figma_take_screenshot` | `getScreenshot()` | Visual capture (PNG) |

**`getComponent(name)` — node search behavior:**

Searches the Figma file tree recursively across all pages. The MCP path uses `depth=3` with `verbosity='full'` (the MCP tool's maximum depth); the REST fallback uses `depth=8`. Both are sufficient for typical file structures (components are at depth 2-3). The `verbosity='full'` parameter is required for the MCP path — the default `'summary'` strips `componentPropertyDefinitions` and all visual properties from nodes.

If the MCP call fails, the adapter falls through to the REST API automatically (not caught by the outer error handler). This ensures Figma metadata is always extracted when credentials are valid.

Matches by exact name (case-insensitive) against any of these node types:

| Figma type | AF `DesignComponent.type` |
|------------|--------------------------|
| `COMPONENT` | `component` |
| `COMPONENT_SET` | `component-set` |
| `INSTANCE` | `instance` |
| `FRAME`, `GROUP`, `SECTION`, `TEXT` | `frame` |

The raw Figma type is preserved in `properties.figmaType`. A warning is added to the result when the matched node is not a `COMPONENT` or `COMPONENT_SET`. `getComponents()` (list all) retains its original behavior and only returns published `COMPONENT`/`COMPONENT_SET` nodes.

**MCP response shape**: The figma-console MCP `figma_get_file_data` tool returns `components` as a count (number), not as a `Record<string, ComponentMeta>` like the REST API. The adapter guards against this with a type check before using the metadata map. `componentPropertyDefinitions` is extracted inline from the document tree nodes (available in `'full'` verbosity) and enriched from top-level `componentSets`/`components` metadata when available.

**Architecture:**
- AF acts as an MCP **client** connecting to figma-console-mcp as the MCP **server**.
- Read-only. No write operations. No mutations.
- AF remains the sole mutation authority (watcher → server → plugin).
- **Default-deny** MCP tool policy: only the 14 tools in `ALLOWED_MCP_TOOLS` may be invoked.
- All 30+ write tools are explicitly blocked (see `BLOCKED_MCP_TOOLS` registry).
- Unclassified tools (not in either list) are also rejected.
- Graceful degradation: if figma-console-mcp is unavailable, AF falls back to REST.
- Every adapter result includes `transport:` metadata for observability.

**Blocked capabilities (by AF architecture, not by omission):**
- `writeDesign` — Design creation is AF plugin's job
- `writeVariables` — Token authority belongs to AF reconciliation engine
- `executeDesignCode` — `figma_execute` bypasses AF control plane
- `writeVariableCollections` — Collection CRUD is AF's responsibility
- `cloudWriteRelay` — `figma_pair_plugin` would create a second control plane
- `writeFigJam` / `writeSlides` — Outside AF scope

**Configuration:**
```bash
export FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=figd_...
export FIGMA_FILE_KEY=your-file-key
```

**Dependencies:**
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` — MCP client SDK (in watcher package)
- `figma-console-mcp` — External MCP server (not a dependency; spawned via npx or connected via SSE)

**Transport validation status:**
- `rest-fallback` — Fully tested (all 47 adapter tests exercise this path).
- `stdio` / `sse` — Implemented, typechecked, config-tested. Live end-to-end validation against a real figma-console-mcp instance is an integration-time check (not part of unit test suite).

### Surface Classification Metadata (Phase 16A Extension)

Phase 16A.1 adds a **taxonomy/descriptor layer** for adapters. This allows AF to categorize external UI surfaces (design tools, runtime views, generators, inspection sources) without introducing any new authority into reconciliation.

**This is a classification layer only.** It does not affect reconciliation logic, precedence, execution order, or mutation paths.

#### Design Principle

Surface metadata consists of four **independent dimensions** that must not be conflated:

| Dimension | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Surface Type** | `SurfaceType` | What kind of UI surface: `design`, `runtime`, `generation`, `inspection` |
| **Access Mode** | `AccessMode` | Mutation capability: `read-only`, `no-mutation`, `internal-write` |
| **Authority Role** | `AuthorityRole` | Whether AF treats data as authoritative: `external-non-authoritative`, `internal-authoritative` |
| **Stability** | `StabilityLevel` | Data stability: `canonical`, `derived`, `observational` |

#### Interface

```ts
interface SurfaceMetadata {
  surfaceType: SurfaceType;
  accessMode: AccessMode;
  authorityRole: AuthorityRole;
  stability: StabilityLevel;
}
```

The `surfaceMetadata` field is **optional** on both `DesignAdapter` and `SemanticAdapter` interfaces to preserve backward compatibility.

#### Current Classifications

| Adapter | Surface Type | Access Mode | Authority Role | Stability |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| FigmaMCPAdapter | `design` | `read-only` | `external-non-authoritative` | `observational` |
| FigmaConsoleMCPAdapter | `design` | `read-only` | `external-non-authoritative` | `observational` |
| VuetifySemanticAdapter | `runtime` | `no-mutation` | `external-non-authoritative` | `derived` |
| AntdSemanticAdapter | `runtime` | `no-mutation` | `external-non-authoritative` | `derived` |
| StorybookAdapter (stub) | `runtime` | `read-only` | `external-non-authoritative` | `observational` |

#### Query Helpers

```ts
// Design adapter registry
getDesignAdaptersBySurface('design')    // → [FigmaMCPAdapter, FigmaConsoleMCPAdapter]
getDesignAdaptersBySurface('runtime')   // → [StorybookAdapter]

// Semantic adapter registry
getSemanticAdaptersBySurface('runtime') // → [VuetifySemanticAdapter, AntdSemanticAdapter]
```

Adapters without `surfaceMetadata` are excluded from surface-type queries.

#### Explicit Non-Goals

The following are **internal reconciliation inputs** and MUST NOT be modeled as adapters:

- `design-overrides.json`
- Marker extraction
- AST-derived values

These remain governed exclusively by the frozen reconciliation precedence: `override > marker > ast > code`.

#### Future Extensibility

New adapters (Penpot, UXPilot, Storybook, etc.) can be classified using the same four dimensions without refactoring:

```ts
// Example: future Penpot adapter
readonly surfaceMetadata: SurfaceMetadata = {
  surfaceType: 'design',
  accessMode: 'read-only',
  authorityRole: 'external-non-authoritative',
  stability: 'observational',
};
```

### Cross-Surface Drift: Metadata Extraction (Phase 16C Enhancement)

Cross-surface drift analysis compares component metadata across three surfaces: **Figma**, **Storybook**, and **Code**. Each surface extracts props and variants independently, then `analyze.ts` compares them.

#### Figma Surface

The primary metadata source is `componentPropertyDefinitions` (CPD) from the Figma REST API. When a component or component set defines property definitions, `findNodeByName()` in the Figma adapter extracts them and passes them through normalization:

```
Figma REST API → findNodeByName() → NormalizedDesignComponent.componentPropertyDefinitions → buildFigmaSnapshot()
```

CPD entries are classified by type:
- **VARIANT**: Creates a variant axis (e.g., `State` with options `['Default', 'Hover']`) and a corresponding prop
- **TEXT**: Creates a text prop (property names like `"Label#12:34"` are cleaned to `"Label"`)
- **BOOLEAN**: Creates a boolean prop
- **INSTANCE_SWAP**: Creates an instance-swap prop

When CPD is absent (older Figma files or non-component nodes), `buildFigmaSnapshot()` falls back to children-based variant inference from normalized variant names.

#### Storybook Surface

Props are extracted from `reactDocgen` metadata via `extractProps()` in `storybookAdapter.ts`. Variants are inferred by `inferVariantAxes()` from prop type unions.

**Story name fallback**: When `inferVariantAxes()` yields no variants but named stories exist, story names are used as variant candidates. A skip-list filters non-variant names: `docs`, `overview`, `page`, `playground`, `template`.

#### Code Surface

`findCodeSurface()` in `cliCrossSurfaceDrift.ts` extracts metadata from TypeScript source:

1. **Props**: Regex matches both destructured parameters (`{ variant, label }`) and `interface`/`type` declarations (`interface ButtonProps { variant?: ...; label?: ... }`)
2. **Variants**: Line-based union extraction finds all quoted values in union types (`'Default' | 'Hover'`)

#### Demo Fixture

`demos/react-demo-app/src/DemoButton.tsx` and `demos/react-demo-app/src/stories/DemoButton.stories.tsx` provide a minimal component with typed props and matching Storybook stories for verifying drift analysis end-to-end.

### Cross-Surface Drift: Normalization Layer (Phase 16D)

Different surfaces use different names for the same concepts, causing false-positive drift findings. Phase 16D adds a **deterministic, configurable normalization layer** that aligns equivalent concepts before comparison.

#### Problem

| Surface | Variant Axis | Text Prop | Layout Props |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Figma | `State` (VARIANT) | `text` (TEXT) | `fills`, `cornerRadius`, `width`, `height` |
| Storybook | `variant` | `label` | (none) |
| Code | `variant` | `label` | (none) |

Without normalization, `State` vs `variant` and `text` vs `label` appear as false drift, and Figma-only layout properties generate noise.

#### Solution

`normalize.ts` in `crossSurfaceDrift/` applies three passes to each surface snapshot **before** comparison:

1. **Design-only filtering** (Figma only): Removes layout/visual properties (`fills`, `cornerRadius`, `width`, `height`, `padding`, `gap`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `textContent`) that have no API-level counterpart
2. **Alias normalization** (all surfaces): Renames equivalent prop names to a canonical form using a configurable alias map
3. **Deduplication**: Merges props that collide after renaming

Default alias rules:

| Canonical | Aliases |
|-----------|---------|
| `variant` | `state`, `variant` |
| `label` | `text`, `label` |

#### Configuration

Normalization is configured via `NormalizationConfig` (defined in `@aesthetic-function/shared/crossSurfaceDrift`):

```typescript
interface NormalizationConfig {
  propAliases: Array<{ canonical: string; aliases: string[] }>;
  designOnlyFields: { names: string[]; strategy: 'exclude' | 'tag' };
}
```

The default config (`DEFAULT_NORMALIZATION_CONFIG` in `normalize.ts`) handles the DemoButton demo. Custom configs can be passed via `DriftAnalysisOptions.normalizationConfig` for per-project overrides.

#### Traceability

Normalization is fully explainable:

- **`SurfaceProp.normalizedFrom`**: When a prop is renamed (e.g., `State` → `variant`), the original name is preserved in `normalizedFrom`
- **`CrossSurfaceDriftReport.normalization`**: The report includes metadata listing all applied alias rules and excluded design-only props, with surface attribution

#### Design Decisions

- Normalization runs **before** comparison, transforming snapshots rather than patching findings. The existing `comparePropInventory` and `compareVariantCoverage` functions require zero changes.
- Design-only filtering applies only to the Figma surface — if Code/Storybook happens to have a prop named `fills`, it is not filtered.
- Alias matching is case-insensitive but the canonical name is always lowercase.
- The `strategy: 'tag'` option (alternative to `'exclude'`) is defined but not yet implemented — it would keep design-only props but mark them for separate "visual drift" reporting.
